teachers of mark. In 1902 the American Library Association
published an annotated guide to the literature of American history,
engaging forty critics and scholars of distinction, with Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
INTRODUCTORY</h2>

<p class="chapstart">Inventors and discoverers are justly among the most
honored of men. It is they who add to knowledge, who
bring matter under subjection both in form and substance, who
teach us how to perform an old task, as lighting, with new economy,
or hand us gifts wholly new, as the spectroscope and the
wireless telegraph. It is they who tell us how to shape an oar
into a rudder, and direct a task with our brains instead of tugging
at it with our muscles. They enable us to replace loss with gain,
waste with thrift, weariness with comfort, hazard with safety.
And, chief service of all, they bring us to understand more and
more of that involved drama of which this planet is by turns the
stage and the spectator&#8217;s gallery. The main difference between
humanity to-day and its lowly ancestry of the tree-top and the
cave has been worked out by the inventors and discoverers who
have steadily lifted the plane of life, made it broader and better
with every passing year.</p>

<p>On a theme so vast as the labors of these men a threshold book
can offer but a few glances at principles of moment, to which
the reader may add as he pleases from observations and experiments
of his own. At the outset Form will engage our
regard: first, as bestowed so as to be retained by girders, trusses
and bridges; next, as embodied in structures which minimize
friction, such as well designed ships; or as conducing to the efficiency
of tools and machines; or deciding how best heat may be
radiated or light diffused. A word will follow as to modes of
conferring form, the influence on form of the materials employed,
and the undue vitality of old forms that should long ago have
bidden us good-by. Structures alike in shape may differ in
size. Bigness has its economies, and so has smallness. Both will
have brief attention, with a rapid survey of new materials which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
enable a builder to rear towers or engines bolder in dimensions
than were hitherto possible.</p>

<p>Substance, as important as form, will next receive a glance.
First a word will be said about the properties of food, raiment,
shelter, weapons and tools. Then, the properties of fuels and
light-givers will be considered, as steadily improved in their effectiveness.
How properties are modified by heat and electricity
will be remarked, with illustrations from steels of new and astonishing
qualities, and from notable varieties of glass produced at
Jena. A few pages will recount some of the striking phenomena
of radio-activity displayed by radium, thorium and kindred substances,
phenomena which are remolding the fundamental conceptions
of physics and chemistry.</p>

<p>A survey of form and properties, however cursory, must involve
measurement, otherwise an inventor cannot with accuracy
embody a plan in a working machine, or know exactly how strong,
elastic, or conducting a rod, a wire, or a frame is. Measuring
instruments will be sketched, their use delineated, and the results
of precise measurement noted as an aid to the construction of
modern mechanism, the interchangeability of its parts, the economy
of materials and of energy in every branch of industry.
Next will follow a chapter noting tasks which Nature has long
accomplished, and which Art has still to perform, as in converting
at ordinary temperatures within the human body fuel energy
into work. Plainly, a broad field opens to future invention as it
copies the function of plants and animals; functions to be first
carefully observed, then explained and at last imitated with the
least possible waste of effort.</p>

<p>The equipment and the talents for invention and discovery are
now touched upon. First, knowledge, especially as the fruit of
disinterested inquiry; Observation, as exercised by trained intelligence
calling to its aid the best modern instruments; Experiment,
as an educated passion for building on original lines. Then,
in the mechanical field, we bestow a few glances at self-acting
machines, at the simplicity of design which makes for economy
not only in building, but in operation and maintenance. Either
in designing a new machine, or in reaching a great truth, such as
Universal Development, there is scope for Imagination upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
which we next pause for a moment. A succeeding chapter outlines
how theories may be launched and tested, how analogy may
yield a golden hint, the profit in rules that work both ways, or
even in doing just the opposite of what has been done without
question for ages past.</p>

<p>From this brief consideration of method we now pass to a few
men who have exemplified method on the loftiest plane; we come
into the presence of Newton, the supreme generalizer, and observe
his patience and conscientiousness, as remarkable as his
resourcefulness in experiment, in mathematical analysis. Even
greater in experiment, while lacking mathematical power, is
Faraday, who next enlists our regard. This great man, more
than any other investigator, laid the foundations of modern electrical
science and art. Moreover he distinctly saw how matter
might reveal itself in the &#8216;radiant&#8217; condition now engaging the
study of the foremost inquirers in physics.</p>

<p>Electricity has no instrument more useful in daily life, or in
pure research, than the telephone. Now follows a narration by its
creator, Professor Bell, of his photophone which transmits speech
by a beam of light. This recital shows us how an inventor of the
first rank proceeds from one attempt to another, until his toil is
crowned with success. Next we hear the story of the Bessemer
process from the lips of Sir Henry Bessemer himself, affording us
an insight into the methods and characteristics of a mind ingenious,
versatile and bold in the highest degree. An inventor
of quite other type is next introduced,&mdash;Nobel, who gave
dynamite to the quarryman and miner, smokeless powder to the
gunner and sportsman. His unfaltering heart, beset as he was
by constant peril, marks him a hero as brave as ever fought
hazardous and dreary campaigns to a victorious close.</p>

<p>Many advances in mechanical and structural art have been won
rather through a succession of attacks by one leader after another,
than by a single decisive blow from a Watt or an Edison. A great
band of inventors, improvers, adapters, have accomplished notable
tasks with no record of such a feat as Bessemer with his converter,
or Abbe with Jena glass. A brief chapter deals with some
of the principal uses of compressed air, an agent of steadily increasing
range. As useful, in a totally different sphere&mdash;that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
building material&mdash;is concrete, especially as reinforced with steel.
A sketch of its applications is offered. Then follows the theme
of using fuels with economy, of obtaining from them motive
powers with the least possible loss. This field is to-day attracting
inventors of eminent ability, with the prospect that soon motive
powers will be much cheapened, with incidental abridgment of
drudgery, a new expansion of cities into the country, and the
production of light at perhaps as little as one-third its present
cost. A page or two are next given to a few social aspects of invention,
its new aid and comfort to craftsmen, farmers, householders
comparatively poor. It will appear that forces working
against the undue centralization of industry grow stronger every
day.</p>

<p>A closing word gives the reader, especially the young reader, a
hint or two in case he wishes to pursue paths of study the first
steps of which are taken in this book.</p>

<p>In 1900 was published the author&#8217;s &#8220;Flame, Electricity and the
Camera,&#8221; in which are treated some of the principal applications
of heat, electricity and photography as exemplified at the time of
writing. That volume may supplement the book now in the
reader&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p class="caption">A lens of ice focussing a sunbeam.</p>
</div>

<p class="chapstart">One January morning in Canada I saw a striking experiment.
The sun was shining from an unclouded sky, while in the
shade a Fahrenheit thermometer stood at about twenty degrees
below zero. A skilful friend of mine had moulded a cake of ice
into a lens as large as a reading glass; tightly fastened in a wooden
hoop it focussed in the open air a sunbeam so as to set fire
to a sheet of paper, and char on a cedar shingle a series of zigzag
lines. There, indeed, was proof of the importance of form. To
have kept our hands in contact with the ice would have frozen
them in a few minutes, but by virtue of its curved surfaces the
ice so concentrated the solar beam as readily to kindle flame.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Clearly enough, however important properties may be, not less
so are the forms into which matter may be fashioned and disposed.
Let us consider a few leading principles by which designers
have created forms that have economized their material,
time and labor, and made their work both secure and lasting. We
will begin with a glance at the rearing of shelter, an art which
commenced with the putting together of boughs and loose stones,
and to-day requires the utmost skill both of architects and engineers.</p>

<h3>Strength and Rigidity.</h3>

<p>Building in its modern development owes as much to improvement
in form as to the use of stronger materials, brick instead
of clay, iron and steel instead of wood. A stick
as cut from a tree makes a capital tent-pole,
and will serve just as well to sustain the roof
of a cabin. For structures so low and light it is not worth while
to change the shape of a stick. By way of contrast let us glance
at an office building of twenty-five stories, or the main piers of
the new Quebec Bridge rising 330 feet above their copings. To
compass such heights stout steel is necessary, and it must be disposed
in shapes more efficient than that of a cylinder, as we shall
presently see.</p>

<p>In most cases strength depends upon form, in some cases
strength has nothing whatever to do with form; if we cut an iron
bar in two its cross-section of say one square inch may be round,
oblong, or of other contour, while the effort required to work the
dividing shears will in any case be the same. But shearing
stresses, such as those here in play, are not so common or important
as the tension which tugs the wires of Brooklyn Bridge, or
the compression which comes upon a pillar beneath the dome
of the national capitol. When we place a lintel over a door or
a window, we are concerned that it shall not sag and let down the
wall above it in ruin: we ensure safety from disaster by giving
the lintel a suitable shape. When we build a bridge we wish its
roadway to remain as level as possible while a load passes, so that
no hills and hollows may waste tractive power: levelness is
secured by a design which is rigid as well as strong. If a railroad
has weak, yielding rails, a great deal of energy is uselessly
exerted in bending the metal as the wheels pass by. A stiff rail,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
giving way but little, avoids this waste. To create forms which
in use will firmly keep their shape is accordingly one of the chief
tasks of the engineer and the architect.</p>

</div>

<h3>Plank and Joist.</h3>

<p>Forms of this kind, well exemplified in the steel columns and
girders of to-day, have been arrived at by pursuing a path opened
long ago by some shrewd observer. This man
noticed that a plank laid flatwise bent much
beneath a load, but that when the plank rested
on its narrow edge, joist fashion, it curved much less, or hardly
at all. Thus simply by changing
the position of his plank
he in effect altered its form
with reference to the strain to
be borne, securing a decided
gain in rigidity. Let us repeat
his experiment, using
material much more yielding
than wood. We take a piece
of rubber eight inches long,
one inch wide and one quarter
of an inch thick. Placing it
flatwise on supports close to
its ends we find that its own
weight causes a decided sag.
We next place it edgewise,
taking care to keep it perpendicular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
throughout its length, when it sags very little. Why? Because
now the rubber has to bend through an arc four times
greater in radius than in the first experiment. Suppose we had a
large board yielding enough to be bent double, we can see that
there would be much more work in doubling it edgewise than flatwise.
The rule for joists is that breadth for breadth their stiffness
varies as the square of their depth, because the circle through
which the bending takes place varies in area as the square of its
radius. In our experiment with the rubber strip by increasing
depth four-fold, we accordingly increased stiffness sixteen-fold;
but the breadth of our rubber when laid as a joist is only one-fourth
of its breadth taken flatwise, so we must divide four into
sixteen and find that our net gain in stiffness is in this case four-fold.</p>

<p class="caption">Telegraph poles under compression. Wires under tension.</p>
</div>

<h3>Girders.</h3>

<p>Here let us for a moment dwell upon the two opposite ways in
which strength may be brought into play, as either compression
or tension is resisted. An example presenting
both is a telegraph pole, with well-balanced
burdens of wires. Its own weight and its load
of wires, compress it, as we can prove by measuring the pole as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
stretched upon the ground before being set in place, and then
after it is erected and duly laden. Should this downward thrust
be excessive, the pole would be crushed and broken down. The
strung wires are not in compression, but in the contrary case of
tension, and are therefore somewhat lengthened as they pass
from one pole to the next. Now observe a mass first subjected
to compression, and next to tension. In bearing a pound weight
a rubber cylinder is compressed and protrudes;
when the weight is suspended from this cylinder,
the rubber is lengthened by tension. In
each case the effect is vastly greater than with
wood or steel, because rubber has so much less
stiffness than they have.</p>

</div><!--figc450-->

<p>Both tension and compression are exhibited
in our little rubber joist, which illustrates the familiar wooden
support beneath the floors of our houses. This form in giving
rise to the girder has been changed for the better. Let us see how.
As the rubber joist sags between its ends, we observe that its
upper half is compressed, and its lower half extended, the two
effects though small being quite measurable. As we approach
the central line, A B, this compression and tension gradually fall
to zero; it is clear that only the uppermost and undermost layers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
fully call forth the strength of the material, the inner layers doing
so little that they may be removed
with hardly any loss.
Hence if we take a common
joist and cut away all but an
upper and lower flange, leaving
just web enough between
to hold them firmly together,
we will have the I-beam which
among rectangular supports is
strongest and stiffest, weight
for weight. In producing it
the engineer has bared within
the joist the skeleton which
confers rigidity, stripping off
all useless and burdensome clothing. An I-beam made of rubber
when laid flatwise over supports at its ends will sag much; when
laid edgewise it will sag but little, clearly showing how due form
and disposal confer stiffness on a structure.</p>

<p>Girders of steel are rolled and riveted together at the mills in
a variety of contours, each best for a specific duty, as the skeleton
of a floor, a column, or a part of a bridge. Their lengths, if desired,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
may far exceed those possible to wood. Their principal
simple forms are the I-beam; T, the tee; L, the angle; C, the
channel; and the Z-bar. Of these the I-beam
is oftenest used; its two parallel
flanges are at the distance apart which
practice approves, they are united by a
web just stout enough not to be twisted or bent in sustaining its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
burdens. Crank shafts of engines, to withstand severe strains, are
built in girder fashion; so are the side-bars of locomotives and the
braces of steel cars. Plates riveted together may serve as compound
girders or columns of great strength and rigidity. In the
New York subway the riveted steel columns which support the
roof have a contour which enlarges at the extremities.</p>

<h3>The Rail.</h3>

<p>By all odds the most important girder is the rail in railroad
service. Let us glance at phases of its development in America,
as illustrating the importance of a right form to
efficient service. At the outset of its operations,
in 1830, the Mohawk &amp; Hudson Railroad, now
part of the New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad, employed
a rail which was a mere strap of iron two and one half inches
wide, nine sixteenths of an inch thick, with upper corners rounded
to a breadth of one and seven eighths inches; it was laid upon a
pine stringer, or light joist, six inches square, and weighed about
14 pounds per yard. Thin as this rail was, its proportions were
adequate to bearing a wheel-flange which protruded but half an
inch or even less. Where the builders of that day sought rigidity
and permanence was in the foundations laid beneath their
stringers. Except upon embankments there were for each track
two pits each two feet square, three feet from centre to centre,
filled with broken stone upon which were placed stone blocks each
of two cubic feet. On the heavy embankments cross-ties were laid;
these were found to combine flexibility of superstructure with
elasticity of roadbed, so that they were adopted throughout the
remainder of the track construction and continue to this hour
to be a standard feature of railroad building.</p>

</div><!--figc600-->

<p>It was soon observed that the surface of a track as it left the
track-maker&#8217;s hands, underwent a depression more or less marked
when a train passed over it. With a strap-iron rail this depression
was so great that engines were limited to a weight of from three
to six tons. Before long the strap form was succeeded by a rail
somewhat resembling in section the rail of to-day. Year by year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the details of rolling rails were improved, so that sections weighing
thirty-five to forty pounds to the yard came into service.
These at length united a hard bearing surface for the wheel-treads,
a guide for the wheel-flanges, and a girder to carry the
wheel-loads and distribute them to the cross-ties. Thereupon the
weights of engines and cars were increased, leading, in turn, to a
constant demand for heavier rails. In 1865 a bearing surface was
reached adequate for wheel-loads of 10,000 to 12,000 pounds, the
rail weighing fifty-six to sixty pounds to the yard. But the metal
was still only iron, and wore rapidly under its augmented burdens.
Then was introduced the epoch-making Bessemer process
and steel was rolled into rails four and one-half inches high, of
fifty-six to sixty-five pounds to the yard, of ten to fifteen-fold
the durability of iron. In design the early steel rails were limber
so that they rapidly cut the cross-ties under their seats, pushing
away the ballast beneath them. Because they lacked height they
had but little stiffness, one result being that the spikes under the
rails were constantly loosened, exaggerating the deflection due to
passing trains. Throughout the lines every joint became low, and
the rails took on permanent irregularities under the pounding
of traffic, dealing harmful shocks to the rolling stock.</p>

<h3>Dudley&#8217;s Track Indicator.</h3>

<p>This was the state of affairs in 1880, when Mr. Plimmon H.
Dudley invented his track-indicator. This apparatus, placed in
a moving car, records by ever-flowing pens
on paper every irregularity, however slight, in
the track over which it passes. When railroad
engineers first saw its records, they believed that the thing to do
was to restore their roads to straightness by the labor of track-men.
It was abundantly proved that the real remedy lay in using
a rail of increased stiffness, that is, a rail higher and heavier.
Mr. Dudley, in the light of records covering thousands of miles
of running, added fifteen pounds to a rail which had weighed
sixty-five pounds, and gave it a height of five inches instead of
four and one half, while he broadened its upper surface. At a
bound these changes increased the stiffness of the section sixty
per cent., the gain being chiefly due to added height. Proof of
this came when his improved rail was found to be much stiffer
than that of the Metropolitan Railway, of London, which weighed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
eighty-four pounds to the yard and had a base of six and three
eighths inches, but a height of only four and one half inches. In
July, 1884, the Dudley rail was laid in the Fourth Avenue viaduct,
New York; so satisfactory did it prove that in less than
two years five-inch rails were in service on three trunk lines.
Then followed their introduction throughout America, their
smoothness and stability as a track giving them acceptance far
and wide.</p>

<p>The performance of the Dudley rail so impressed Mr. William
Buchanan, Superintendent of Motive Power for the New York
Central Railroad that in 1889 he planned his famous passenger
engine, No. 870, which entered upon active duty in April, 1890.
It carried 40,000 pounds upon each of its two pairs of driving
wheels, instead of 31,250, as did its heaviest predecessor; its truck
bore a burden of 40,000 pounds more; its loaded tender weighed
80,000 pounds, making a total of 100 tons, an advance of forty
per cent. beyond the weight of the heaviest preceding engine and
tender. Mr. Buchanan&#8217;s forward stride has been worthily followed
up. Since 1890, passenger locomotives have nearly doubled
in the weight borne upon their axles, while tractive power has
increased in the same degree. Through express and mail trains
have more than doubled in weight, and their speeds have increased
thirty to forty per cent. The tonnage of an average freight train
has been augmented four to six-fold, with reduction of the crews
necessary to keep a given amount of tonnage in motion. This
economy is reflected in a reduction of rates which are now in
America the lowest in the world, and which steadily fall. In
capacity for business united with stability of roadbed, mainly
due to stronger and stiffer rails and to adapted improvement in
rolling stock, railroad progress in the past fifteen years is equal
to that of the sixty years preceding. With rails increased to a
weight of 100 pounds to the yard there is shown, even in passing
over the joints, an astonishing degree of smoothness as contrasted
with the jolting action of rails comparatively low and
light. Stiffness of rail reduces the destructive action of service,
originally enormous, upon both equipment and track, lowering in
a marked degree the cost of maintenance. Size of rail as well
as form plays a part in this economy. A passenger train weighing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
378 tons has required 820 horse power on 65-pound rails, and
but 720 horse power on 80-pound rails, the speed in both cases
being 55 miles an hour; it is estimated that with 105-pound rails
620 horse power would have sufficed. In freight service Dudley
rails have reduced the resistances per ton from between 7 and
8 pounds to one half as much; a further reduction, to 3 pounds,
is in prospect. In passenger service, with rails of unimproved
type the resistance at 52 miles an hour is 12 pounds per ton;
with Dudley rails this resistance for heavy trains is not augmented
when the speed rises to 65 or 70 miles an hour. Dudley
rails, and rails derived from their designs, are now in use on
three fourths of all the trackage of American railroads, effecting
a vast economy. Seventy-five years ago the DeWitt Clinton
locomotive and tender weighed only five sixths as much as the
main pair of driving wheels, boxes, axle, and connecting rods of
the present Atlantic type of engine. That such an engine can
haul a heavy train at seventy miles an hour largely depends upon
the production of that simple and important element in railroading,
its rail.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<h3>Roofs and Bridges Much Alike.</h3>

<p class="chapstart">Rails are girders used by themselves: girders are often combined
in trusses; of these much the largest and most important
are employed for bridges. There is now under construction
near Quebec a cantilever bridge whose channel span of 1,800
feet will be the longest in the world. See
<a href="#Page_29">page 29</a>. It will take us a little while to
understand how so bold a flight as this was
ever dared. We will begin with a glance at a truss of the simplest
sort, such as we may find beneath the roof of an old-fashioned
barn. A pair of rafters, AB and AC, are inclined to each other
at an obtuse angle, and are fastened to the horizontal beam, BC,
at B and C. Their apex,
A, is joined to BC by the
king-post, AK, which binds
the three strongly and firmly.
This whole structure
makes up a triangle, and so
does each of its halves,
ABK and AKC. No other
shape built of straight
pieces will keep its form
under strain. Take in
proof say four pieces of
lath and unite them with a freely turning pin at each corner to
make the frame, ABCD; it is easily distorted by a slight pull or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
push; but insert cross-pieces, AC and BD so as to divide the
square into triangles, and at once the
frame resists any strain not severe
enough to break the wood or crush
its fastenings. As the roof presses
down the frame ABC, its sides, AB
and AC, tend to slide away at their
lower ends, B and C, but this is prevented
by the horizontal beam, BC,
which while it holds them in place is
itself so stretched as to be held level
and straight. This calling into play of
tension constitutes the chief merit of
the truss, and enables it in roofs and
bridges to span breadths impossible to
simple beams bending downward under
compressive strains. Not only in
houses, but in ships, the truss has
great value; it was introduced in this
field by Robert Seppings of Chatham,
in England, about 1810. To resist the
pressure of grinding ice, the &#8220;Roosevelt&#8221;
is built with trusses of great
strength. She sailed in 1905, under
Commander Peary, for a voyage of
Arctic discovery.</p>

<p class="caption">Frames of four sides. For
rigidity diagonals are
needed, AC, BD.</p>
</div>

<p>Were our barn roof flat instead of
sloping to form a truss, its supporting timbers, under compression,
would have a decided sag from which BC is free. When we
fashion a small model of a king-post truss, its sides, AB and AC,
must be of metal or wood because they will be in compression;
the king-post, AK, and the base, BC, which will be under tension,
may be of rubber or cord. Always as in this case the parts of a
truss exposed to compression must be of rigid material. When a
part may be of cord, rope or wire, we know that it is resisting
tension.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> A model easily put together illustrates the truss in its simplest form.
Take a pair of wooden compasses, each half of which is 15 inches long,
such as are sold for blackboard use by the Milton Bradley Co., Springfield,
Mass., at 50 cents. At each tip fasten, by the ring provided with
the compasses, a chair castor such as may be had at any hardware store.
Join the tips of the castors by a rubber strip. Holding the compasses
upright, and applying pressure from the hand, they will extend until the
rubber will be so stretched as to become almost perfectly horizontal.
Various weights may in succession be suspended from the compass-joint,
replacing manual pressure, and serving to measure the exerted tensions.</p>

<p>Wrought iron exerts about as much resistance to compression
as to tension; so does steel. For this reason, and on account of
their great strength, they have immense value in building. Cast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
iron can bear only about one sixth as much tension as compression,
so that it is useful as foundations, for the bed-plates of engines
and machinery and the like, but is unsuitable for girders.
Wood is much stronger under tension than compression; in white
pine this proportion is as eight to one. In designing timber
bridges the strains are, therefore, as far as possible, arranged for
tension.</p>

<p>Let us now enter another barn, about one half wider than the
first, and look upward at its rafters. We see its roof sustained by
timbers disposed as DCMH,
to avoid the undue weight
necessary for a design resembling
that of our first
roof, ABC. Instead of one
upright post, AK, as in that
case, we have now two, DE
and HO, called queen-posts,
sustaining the horizontal
beam, CM. In
large modern roofs the
simple queen-post is modified and multiplied, as in the main power
house of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, West 59th St.,
New York. Returning to our simple queen-post design, let us
imagine a creek flowing between walls spanned by DCMH; that
truss and a mate to it, parallel at a distance of say ten feet, would
easily carry a roadway and give us a bridge. A truss for a bridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
must be much stronger than for a roof of equal span, because a
bridge has to bear moving loads which may come upon it suddenly,
giving rise not only to serious strains but to severe
vibrations, all varying from moment to moment.</p>

<h3>Palladio&#8217;s Long Neglected Truss.</h3>

<p>The queen-post truss was remarkably developed by Palladio, a
famous Italian architect of the sixteenth century. Two of his
designs, here given in outline, are from his
work on architecture published in 1570; their
contours, little changed, are in vogue to-day.
Strangely enough the trusses of Palladio, for all their merit, passed
out of notice until their principles were revived and improved by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Theodore Burr, in 1804, in a wooden bridge over the Hudson at
Waterford, New York. This bridge had spans respectively of
154, 160 and 180 feet, stretches impossible to single wooden beams.
Professor J. B. Johnson, an eminent engineer, says that this is the
most scientific design ever invented for an all-wooden bridge;
during fifty years it stood unrivaled as a model for highway purposes
in this country. The Burr bridges were usually covered in,
so as to resemble the roofs we began by inspecting. In a truss
bridge each part bounded by two adjacent uprights, as DOEH in
the <a href="#Fig22">queen-post</a> figure on page 21, is a <i>panel</i>; every part under
compression, as DO, HE, is a <i>strut</i>, <i>post</i>, or <i>column</i>; every part
subject to tension as DE, HO, is a <i>tie</i>.</p>

<p class="caption">Burr Bridge, Waterford, N. Y.<br />

</div>

<p>In 1830 as the first American railroad train sped on its way, a
new era dawned for the bridge builder as well as for his neighbors.
At once sprang up a demand for bridges longer and stronger
than those which in the past had served well enough. A score of
wagons laden with wheat or potatoes were a good deal lighter
than a locomotive followed by a train of loaded freight cars. A
market-wagon, too, could easily be taken aboard a ferry-boat, but
for an engine and its cars a bridge was imperative, if the stream
were not so wide as to forbid all opportunity to the bridge builder.
His response to the demands of the railroad was two-fold. First in
the use of metal instead of wood, beginning with iron rods to
bind together frames of timber. As iron became cheaper and its
value more and more evident, he employed it for additional parts
of his structure until at last he built the whole bridge of iron.</p>

<p>To-day good steel is so cheap that railroad bridges are seldom
reared of anything else. Besides using stronger materials, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
designer has gradually improved the form of his structure, not
only in its parts but as a whole, so that to-day, strength for
strength, a bridge may be only one tenth as heavy as a bridge of
fifty years ago. Advances in form have been due to experience
as one type has been compared with another; meanwhile the
mathematicians have carried their analysis of strains as far as
the extreme complexity of their problems will allow, greatly to
the betterment of designs.</p>

<p>In building a bridge, as in rearing many other structures, girders
of various contours are used. In bridge building the I-beam
is most employed. When the roadway proceeds on the top
chord, as DH, in the <a href="#Fig22">queen-post</a> figure, page 21, we have a deck
bridge; when it is built on the bottom chord, as CM, we have a
through bridge.</p>

<h3>The Burr Bridge Simplified by Howe and Pratt.</h3>

<p>The Burr bridge of 1804, already mentioned, included an arch
and was in part sustained by struts projecting from abutments.
These features were omitted by William Howe
in the bridge which he patented in 1840, and
which was, as far as is known, the first successor
to a design of Palladio in employing a
simple truss for long spans. The Howe truss
was built of wood, except its terminal tie-rods, which were of
iron; it has been repeated thousands of times throughout the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
world. In 1844 Thomas W. and Caleb Pratt patented a bridge
which in design was the converse of Howe&#8217;s. Its diagonals of
iron were used in tension, while its vertical struts of timber were
in compression; in the Howe pattern the diagonals were in compression,
the verticals in tension. This plan, by shortening the
struts, diminished the cross-section necessary in a truss. When
wrought iron took the place of wood for bridges, the Pratt
design became the most popular of all, combining as it did more
desirable features than any of its rivals. To-day for long spans
the Baltimore truss is much in favor. Its stresses, that is, its resistances
to change of form under strain, are readily ascertained;
the shortness of its panels means strength; and its diagonals have
the inclination which wide and varied experience has shown most
desirable. The roadway, it will be observed, is upheld by sub-verticals,
that is, by verticals which reach the floor from half the
height of a panel.</p>

<p class="caption">Whipple Bridge.</p>
</div>

<p>An important study concerns itself with the intensity and distribution
of strains, first in girders, next in trusses, and lastly, in
bridges as units, all with intent to ensure the best possible designs
throughout. In this field of inquiry the pioneer was Squire
Whipple, a maker of mathematical instruments in Utica, N. Y.,
who published in 1847 his analysis of the strains in a truss bridge
due to its own weight and to its moving loads. With the laws of
these strains in mind he devised several bridges of great merit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the most noteworthy being reared in 1852 on the Rensselaer &amp;
Saratoga Railroad, seven miles north of Troy, which did service
until 1883; its sides or web system had ties extended across two
panels in double intersection.</p>

<p>In a long truss bridge, which in its entirety may be regarded
as a girder of the utmost size, the cross pieces between the main
beams of the structure are much less heavy than if continuous
plates, of no more strength. The original form of the Victoria
Bridge at Montreal was that of a continuous tube of iron, square
in section; it has given place to a truss bridge of five times greater
capacity which weighs only twice as much. (<a href="#Fig31">Illustrations</a> of both
on pages 27 and 28.)</p>

<p>Thus to lessen weight in comparison with strength is a matter
of great importance in a suspended structure, which must not
only bear its own weight, but carry heavy moving loads.</p>

<h3>Advantages of the Cantilever, Arch, and Bowstring Designs.</h3>

<p>In most cases a bridge crosses a valley or a river in a place
which permits the engineer to erect scaffolding to support his
trusses until they can be united and become
self-sustaining. In some places this course is
denied; a river such as the Ohio or the Mississippi
may have to be spanned at a point where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27-<br />30]</a><br /><a name="Page_28"
id="Page_28"></a><br /><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><br /><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span>
waters in a single day may rise forty feet, bearing along trees and
timbers with destructive violence. As a rule the difficulty is met by
employing cantilever spans which require no scaffolding for their
construction. To understand their principle let us suppose that
on opposite banks of a creek we roll out to meet each other the
joists FG and HI, taking care that the parts over the water shall
always be lighter than the parts on land. When the joists at last
touch they are secured to each other as a continuous roadway. Or,
while they are at a moderate distance apart they may be joined
by a third timber laid across the gap from one to the other. In
practice the simple principle thus illustrated is developed and
varied in many ways, but in every application the one rule is that
the trusses as they stretch out from the two sides of a pier shall
balance each other, the shore ends being duly weighted down or
safely anchored to solid rock. And thus, at length, we come to
the wonderful bridge, six miles west of Quebec, whose channel
span of 1,800 feet will be the longest ever reared. See <a href="#Fig33">illustration</a>,
page 29. From the cantilever arms, DA and BE, will be suspended
the central truss, AB, of 675 feet. A cantilever span may be much
longer than a simple truss because on a pier, as D of this bridge,
a part, DA, of the whole span, DE, is balanced either, as in this
case, by a shore span, CD, or by a corresponding part of the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
span should that span not extend to the shore but pass from one
pier to another.</p>

<p class="caption">Arch bridge, Niagara Falls</p>
</div>

<p>Spanning the gorge of Niagara, close to the Falls, is an arch
bridge of 840 feet in its central span, which, in its construction
during 1898, followed the plan originated by James B. Eads in
building the St. Louis bridge nearly thirty years before. As scaffolding
was out of the question in both cases, each bridge was
built out from its piers on the cantilever principle. An arch is
sometimes disguised as a modified bowstring, as in the Burr design
of 1804, a horizontal tie connecting the extremities of the
arched rib and taking its thrust, dispensing with the abutments
demanded by an arch. In the chords of such a pattern the strength
comes as near to uniformity throughout as practical considerations
permit, avoiding the losses of early days when one part of a
bridge might be twice as strong as another. The bowstring was
adopted for the great span of 542<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> feet over the Ohio at Cincinnati
built in 1888, and for the span of 546<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> feet erected at
Louisville in 1893. A bowstring 533 feet long, forming part of
the Delaware river bridge of the Pennsylvania Railroad, built in
1896, in Philadelphia, is outlined on <a href="#Page_32">page 32</a>. At Bonn, on the
Rhine, there was completed in 1904 a bridge whose central span
is a bowstring 616<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> feet long.</p>

<h3>Suspension Bridges and Continuous Girders.</h3>

<p>If we take the design of an arch bridge and turn it upside down
we have a contour such as that of the Williamsburg Suspension
Bridge, opened in 1903 between Brooklyn and
Manhattan, <a href="#Fig37">depicted</a> on page 33. For the utmost
length this is the only available span; it
brings into play the tensile strength of wire, the strongest form
that steel can take. A steel cable of suitable diameter, if it had to
support only itself, might safely be three miles long. A suspension
bridge has another advantage in employing an anchorage to
bear strains which would break down a simple truss resting on
piers. As first erected suspension bridges were liable to extreme
and harmful vibration, in many cases being shaken to pieces by
storms of no great violence. It was found that this vibration was
checked and that safety was ensured by introducing stiffening
trusses which, at the same time, benefited the bridge by distributing
the load uniformly throughout the sustaining cables.</p>

<p class="caption">WILLIAMSBURG BRIDGE, NEW YORK CITY.</p>
</div>

<p>At Lachine, about eight miles west of Montreal, on the line of
the Canadian Pacific Railroad, a remarkable bridge crosses the
St. Lawrence river. Its design is that of a continuous girder of
four spans, the two side spans being 269 feet each in length, and
the two others each 408 feet. This type is discussed by Mr. Mansfield
Merriman and Mr. Henry S. Jacoby in Part IV, page 30, of
their work on Roofs and Bridges. One of the advantages presented
is that deflection under live load is less, and stiffness
greater than for simple, discontinuous girders, the harmful effect
of oscillation being thus diminished. Furthermore, less material
is required than for simple, discontinuous spans. Both these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33-<br />34]</a><br /><a
name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>
elements of gain are brought out in placing a strip of rubber, AD,
upon four equidistant points of support, when we find that BC,
the central third of the strip sags less than either AB or CD, the
first or last third. Cutting off one-third of the whole strip we
deprive the removed piece, at its surface of separation, of the
cohesion which did much to keep the whole strip, before cutting,
almost horizontal at that point. We take AB, our short removed
piece of rubber, and lay it at its ends on two points of support;
it now serves in a rough-and-ready way as a model of a simple
truss, all by itself; its decided sag shows it much less rigid than
when it formed a part of an unbroken and longer structure.
Continuous girders despite their advantages are seldom employed;
they are liable to serious difficulties; among these may
be mentioned that changes, often unavoidable, of level in piers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and abutments cause them to suffer great reversals of stress, always
a source of danger; furthermore, variations of length due to
changes of temperature are, of course, much greater and more
troublesome to provide against than in the case of discontinuous
girders.</p>

<h3>Best Proportions for Spans: A Slight Upward Curve is Gainful. Pins or Rivets in Fastening.</h3>

<p>Whether spans are long or short, engineers are fairly well
agreed as to the best proportions for girders and panels. They
consider that a girder should have about one-twelfth
to one-tenth as much depth as span;
and that the weight of a web should be about
equal to that of its flanges. They usually give
panels twice as much depth as length, with a
tendency to increase the proportion of depth to length, in order
to minimize the deflections and oscillations which shorten the
life of a structure. For definite lengths of span, particular types of
construction are preferred; usually for lengths of from 20 to 125
feet, plate girders are chosen; for spans of 125 to 150 feet riveted
lattice trusses are built; for spans of 150 to 600 feet pin-connected
trusses are employed. Here we reach the economical limit of a
length for simple trusses; beyond 600 feet the engineer is obliged
to have recourse either to a cantilever or a suspension bridge.</p>

<p>Whatever the breadth of the stream or the chasm over which
he is to build a roadway, each case must be studied in the light of
its special circumstances. There must be due regard to business
as well as to engineering considerations; the designer will bear in
mind that types of parts customarily turned out at great steel
works are procurable in less time, and at less cost, than novel types
requiring to be manufactured to order. Then, in speed of construction,
he will remember that a pin-connected bridge can be
built much faster than a riveted structure. Furthermore, every
part must be vastly stronger than ordinary duty requires. Tempests
and floods may suddenly arise; at any instant a derailment or
a collision may create a strain of the utmost severity; and even
under ordinary circumstances it must not be forgotten that train
loads grow constantly heavier because economy lies that way.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>One detail of bridge design is worth a moment&#8217;s attention.
When a book-shelf is a thin board, quite straight as manufactured,
it sags in the middle when fully burdened. This downward dip
may be avoided by making the shelf at first with a slight curve
which brings the middle a little higher than the ends. In bridge
building a like curve, or camber, is given to each span so that when
fully loaded it will be level or nearly so. In a span of 500 feet
it is found that a rise of half a foot at the centre is sufficient. In
suspension bridges, for the sake of strengthening the structure,
the camber far exceeds this ratio.</p>

<div class="figc350" id="Fig43">
<img src="images/illo067.png" alt="" width="350" height="308" />
<p class="caption">Pin connecting parts of a bridge.</p>
</div>

<p>In fastening together the parts of a bridge the usual American
practice, already mentioned, is to employ pins which pass through
eye bars. In England riveting is preferred, as shown in the <a href="#Fig41">figure</a>
of the lattice truss, page 36. This difference in methods arose
through the use of materials
which differed. In the construction
of bridges the
English engineer started
with the flanged girder of
cast or rolled iron, or some
other form of stiff beam,
and as bridges increased in
size so as to require the
framing of a truss, his
whole effort was directed
toward making that truss as
much like the original
flanged or box girder as
possible. The American engineer,
on the other hand, had at first little or no iron or steel to
work with, and of necessity used wood. As the necessary bridges
were of considerable span, the only feasible method was to pin
together small pieces of wood so as to form a connected series of
triangles. To make rigid joints in wood was impracticable, and
indeed rigid joints were not desired, because the strength of wood
is slight when strains are applied in any direction other than that
of the fibres of the piece, and the pin joint insures just this line of
action. As a rule a riveted bridge requires more metal than a pin-connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
design, takes more time to build, but demands somewhat
less skill. To provide for changes in length as a bridge is
subjected to variations of temperature, friction rollers are used
to support its extremities. In the first suspension bridge at
Niagara Falls, built by Roebling, a little cement accidentally covered
the friction rollers and
prevented them from turning;
fortunately the structure
escaped the destruction to
which it was thus exposed.</p>

</div>

<p>We have now taken a rapid
survey of some of the methods
by which the designer of
bridges plans a structure
which is at once safe and to
the utmost extent economical
of material. Step by step he
has discovered how little steel
he may use for designs all the
bolder because his hand is so
sparing of weight. His success
began in adopting the
girder, which we have seen to
be in effect the working skeleton long concealed within the common
joist; the cantilever span near Quebec, which compasses
1,800 feet in its flight, has been dissected out of preceding burden
bearers in the same way. Its metal stands forth as so much sheer
muscle kept to the most telling lines, unencumbered by a single
pound of idle substance. A designer of such a fabric is an artist
skilled in disengaging from masses of material every ounce that
can be wisely removed. In some cases, as when Roebling linked
together New York and Brooklyn, a bridge is created as much a
thing of beauty as of use, as graceful as it is strong.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<h3>Hollow Columns and Tubes.</h3>

<p>In lofty structures, the box girder is frequently employed as a
column or a beam because it has even greater rigidity than the
I-beam; usually it has four sides, but it may
have eight, sixteen, or more, and thus step by
step we come to a hollow cylindrical column
which has, indeed, the best form that can be bestowed on supporting
material. Chinese builders learned its economy on the
distant day when they adopted the bamboo for their walls and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
roofs. Comparison with a solid stick of timber of like weight and
substance will show that an equal length of bamboo is decidedly
preferable. The inner half of a round solid stick does comparatively
little in holding up a burden; to remove that half is
therefore as gainful as to strip from a joist the timber surrounding
its working skeleton. At first the journals or axles of engines
and large machines, as well as the axles of railroad cars and the
shafts of steamships were solid; to-day, in a proportion which
steadily increases, they are hollow. The advantage of this form
comes out when we take two cylinders of rubber, alike in length
and weight, one solid, the other hollow. Supporting both at their
ends, the hollow form sags less than the solid form, proving itself
to be the more rigid of the two.</p>

<p>With like advantage seamless tubing is adopted for a broad
variety of purposes. It builds bicycles and sulkies which far out-speed
vehicles of solid frames; it is
worked up into elevator cages,
mangle rolls, pneumatic tools, fishing-rods,
magazine-rifle tubes, inking
rollers, farm machinery, poles,
masts and much else where strength
and lightness are to be united. Steel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
tubing is readily bent into any needed contour, even when of
considerable diameter. Mr. Egbert P. Watson has pointed
out its availability for
highway bridges of about
forty feet span, no professional
bridge-builders being
needed for their construction.
Near Saxonville,
Massachusetts, a pipe-arch
bridge, eighty feet long,
provides a roadway across
the Sudbury River, while
carrying within its pipe a
stream which forms part of
the Boston water system. A
bridge of similar form, 200
feet long, spans Rock Creek
in the City of Washington. The Eads bridge crossing the Mississippi,
at St. Louis, employs for each span eight steel tubes of nine
inches exterior diameter.
Tubes large and small have
been strengthened by adopting
the model of an old-fashioned
fire-lighter, or
spill, a bit of paper rolled
spirally as a hollow tube.
Blow sharply into it and you but tighten its joints. In like manner
tubes and pipes of metal are all the tighter when their seams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
are spiral instead of longitudinal. An eager quest for combined
strength and lightness in the bicycle has ended in the choice of
tubes spirally welded.</p>

<h3>Arches.</h3>

<p>When builders of old began to rear masonry they repeated in
stone or brick the forms they had constructed in wood. Accordingly
the lintels of their doors and windows
were flat. It was a remarkable step in advance
when the arch was invented, probably by a
bricklayer, spanning widths impossible to horizontal structures.
A flat course of stone or brick presses downward only; an arch
presses sidewise as well as downward. It is this sidewise thrust,
calling into play a new resource, that gives the arch its structural
advantage. In modern masonry the boldest arch is that of the
bridge at Plauen, Germany, with its span of 295<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> feet.
Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
pointed arches the chief sustain the walls of Gothic cathedrals; it
was to counteract the outward thrust of these arches that external
buttresses were reared,
either solid, as at St. Remy in
Rheims, or flying, as at Notre
Dame in Paris. The Saracenic
arch, offering more than half
of a circle, is not so strong as
the Roman arch, but it has a
grace of its own, fully revealed
in the Alhambra, and
in the incomparable mosque
at Cordova. A chain of small
links, a watch-chain, for example,
freely hanging between
two points of support strikes
out a catenary curve; this Galileo
suggested as the outline
for an arch in equilibrium; it
is adopted for suspension
bridges.</p>

</div>

<p>&#8220;The arch,&#8221; says Mr. William
P. P. Longfellow in
&#8220;The Column and the Arch,&#8221;
&#8220;was the great constructive
factor in the architecture of
the Roman Empire; it added enormously to the builder&#8217;s resources
in planning, and to his means of architectural effect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
It gave him the means of spanning wide openings, and
when expanded into the vault, of covering great spaces; it
habituated him to curved lines and surfaces. Helped by it, and
spurred by the new wants of the complex Roman civilization, he
enlarged the scale of his buildings and greatly increased the intricacy
of their plans. He used his new combinations with a boldness
and fertility of invention that have been the wonder of the
world from that age to ours, constructing on a scale that dwarfed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
everything that had gone before except the colossal buildings of
Egypt. Under a new stimulus, and with new means of effect,
Roman building greatly outstripped that of the Greeks in extent,
in variety, and magnificence.&#8221;</p>

<p>An arch built on its side, with its convexity upstream, and its
ends braced against rocky banks, serves admirably as a dam. It
has in many cases withstood floods much higher than those expected
by its designers. Such dams must not be too long, or
what is saved in thickness is more than lost in length. Arches
inverted are used in many places as gulleys for drainage. Near
Bristol, in England, they anchor the cables of the Clifton Suspension
Bridge, at a depth of eighty-two feet below the surface
of the ground. Many tunnels finished in masonry have outlines
which are two arches united, the lower arch being inverted. The
Cloaca Maxima, the famous sewer at Rome, is of this pattern;
it is twenty-six feet high, sixteen feet broad, and is now in its
twenty-fifth century of service.</p>

<h3>Circles and Other Curves.</h3>

<p>From arches, built of parts of circles, let us pass to the circle
itself, and glance at the use of tubes of circular section as we begin
to consider how resistances to motion may
be minimized. The use of the bamboo not only
for building, but for the carriage of water, began
in the remote past. As structural material it was light and
strong as we have noticed; laid upon the ground it was a ready-made
water pipe of excellent form. When
trees were hollowed out to convey water,
when clay was modeled into tubes, the
hollow cylindrical shape of the bamboo
was in the mind of the Asiatic artisan, to
be faithfully copied. That form has descended
to all modern piping for water,
steam, and gas, because the best that a
pipe can take. No other shape has, proportionately
to capacity, so little surface
for friction inside or rust outside. A locking-bar
water pipe, devised by Mephan
Ferguson, of Perth, Australia, is made of
two plates of equal width, curved into
semi-circles which are pressed at their ends into channel bars of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
soft steel. As the locking-bars and joints are opposite each other,
their joints can be tightly closed by a simple machine which exerts
pressure in a straight line. This construction may be used not
only for pipes, but for hydraulic cylinders, air receivers, mud and
steam drums, tubular boilers and boiler shells where high pressures
are to be withstood.</p>

<p>A steam boiler or other vessel under severe internal strains had
best be spherical if equality to resistance is particularly desired.
Usually a cylindrical shape is much more convenient, and
no other is given to simple steam boilers or to the tubes of water-tube
or fire-tube boilers. Tubes comparatively narrow, are readily
manufactured without seam, so that they may be quite safe though
thin; large boilers of plates riveted together, must be built of thick
metal. It was estimated by Mr. F. Reuleaux, the eminent engineer,
that if such boilers could be made in one continuous piece
of metal by the Mannesmann process, so successful in tube-making,
an economy in weight of at least one third would be feasible.</p>

<img src="images/illo076.png" alt="" width="250" height="430" />
<p class="caption">Hand-hole plates.<br />
Erie City water-tube boiler.</p>
</div>

<p>In water-tube boilers a gainful
departure from the circular form in
a detail of their design is worthy of
notice. In order that their tubes
may be kept sound and clean they
are rendered accessible by hand-holes
which pierce the front and
back of the boiler. Usually these
hand-holes and their covers are
round, a form which makes it necessary
to put the cover outside the
boiler where even a good joint, well
stayed, may leak or give way under
a pressure which tends to force
apart the cover and its seat. In
the Erie City boiler the covers are
elliptical; they are readily passed
through the hand-holes so as to rest
not on the outside, but on the inside,
of the boiler, where the steam pressure
makes their joints all the tighter. A further advantage is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
that each elliptical plate is large enough to give access to two
tubes instead of one, lessening the lines of juncture along which
leakage may occur.</p>

<h3>Wheels.</h3>

<p>It was a memorable day when first a round log or stick was
thrust under a burden, easing its motion and leading to the wheel
by piecemeal improvements. A section cut off
from the end of a round log is to-day the wheel
for ox-carts in China and India. In its crudest
form a roller enables a man to drag a load instead of carrying it,
and he can readily drag much more than he can carry. Wheelwrights
of old soon found that a wheel need not be solid, that
strong spokes, a sound rim, and a metal tire embody the utmost
strength and lightness. Roller and ball bearings much extend
the benefits of simple wheels; they lessen friction in the best
typewriters, bicycles, and elevators; in wagons, carriages, and
automobiles roller bearings are so helpful that their use should be
universal. Of notable efficiency is the Hyatt bearing, formed by
winding a steel strip into a spiral roller. This device has a flexibility
which enables it to conform to irregularities of motion
much better than can a solid cylinder.</p>

<p>For machinery the wheel is indispensable. The hand does its
work chiefly in moving to and fro, as in sawing and whittling.
Machines outdo manual toil by moving swiftly and continuously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
in a circle: instead of the
smoothing iron we have the
mangle, boards are planed
by rotary knives, timber is
divided by circular saws,
and the steam turbine is
displacing the steam engine
which every moment has to
check the momentum of
huge reciprocating masses.
Noteworthy in this regard
is the perfecting press
which prints a newspaper
from a continuous roll, as
contrasted with the old
machine which demanded
for each impression a distinct
series of to and fro
movements. The Harris
Rotary Press for job printing
is of like model. It
feeds itself with 6,500
sheets an hour, printing
from a stereotype or an
electrotype curved upon its
cylinder. The lathe, simple
enough a century ago, has
been developed into machines
of great complexity,
power, and variety, all with
the original rotary mandrel
as their essential feature.
Milling machines, steadily
gaining more and more
importance, employ rotary
cutters which dispense with
the manual chipping and filing of former days.</p>

<h3>Angles Replaced by Curves.</h3>

<p>Wood as commonly hewn, sawn, and planed; bricks as usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
molded; stone as it leaves an ordinary hammer, all have flat sides
and square edges. Hence it has been easiest to
build walls and floors which meet at right
angles, and to leave sharp corners on outer
walls, windows, doorways, and chimneys. This
is being changed for
the better; in staircases
the boards on
which we tread and
those which join them
together now meet in
smooth curves; so do
the walls of rooms as
they reach ceilings
and floors, conducing
to ease and thoroughness
in sweeping and
cleansing. In outer
walls, in doorways
and windows, similar
curves reduce liability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
to hurt and harm. A wagon wheel easily knocks pieces from an
angle of brickwork; it makes little impression on bricks retiring
from the street line in a sweeping curve, as in the Madison
Square Garden, New York. Factory chimneys have long been
built round instead of square;
to-day in the best designs the
ducts to a chimney are also
freely curved. In blast furnaces
this is the rule for every
part of the structure, ensuring
gain in strength, lessening resistance
to the flow of gases,
and thus saving much fuel.
When waterpipes varying in
diameter are joined, the junction
should be a gradual curve,
otherwise retarding eddies
will arise, wasting a good deal
of energy; the same precaution
is advisable in laying pipes for steam or gas. The elbows of
pipes for gas, steam or water exert the least possible friction when
given the utmost feasible
radius. All the various
parts of heavy guns are
curved, since any sharpness
of angle at a joint brings in
a hazard of rupture under
the tremendous strains of
explosion.</p>

<p>Embossing and stamping machines may either decorate a sheet
of note paper or make a tub from a plate of steel. Whatever their
size these machines have the edges of their dies nicely rounded,
so as to avoid tearing the material they fashion. To ensure the
utmost strength in the machines themselves they are contoured in
ample curves. In hydraulic presses, subjected to strains vastly
greater, the same shaping is imperative, otherwise a cylinder may
part abruptly with disastrous effect. So, too, in the manufacture
of magnets and electro-magnets, their terminals are well rounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
to ensure the closest possible approach to uniformity of field and
of working effect.</p>

<p>A glance at a warship discovers her varied use of curves in defence;
to deflect assailing shot and shell, her plates are given
bulging lines, her turrets are built in spherical contours, and her
casemates are convex throughout. On much the same principle
fortifications are rendered bomb-proof, or rather bomb-shedding;
while outworks are so inclined that bombs fall to distances at
which they do little or no harm. As in war so in peace; there is
gain in building breakwaters with an easy curve; to give their
masonry and timbers a perpendicular face would be to invite
damage, whereas a flowing contour like that of a shelving beach,
slows down an advancing breaker and checks its shock. In rearing
lighthouses to bear the brunt of ocean storms the outline of a
breakwater is repeated to the utmost degree feasible. Often, however,
the base supporting a lighthouse is too small in area for such
an outline to be possible.</p>

<h3>Forms of Ships Adapted to Special Resistances.</h3>

<p class="chapstart">In giving form to a ship a designer has a three-fold aim,&mdash;strength,
carrying capacity and speed. Strength is a matter
of interior build as much as of external walls; it is conferred by
girders, stays and stiffeners which we have already considered,
so that we may here pass to the general form
of the hull, which decides how much freight a
ship may carry, and, to a certain extent, how
fast she may run. A ship is the supreme
example of form adapted to minimize resistance to motion; its
lesson in that regard will be the chief theme of this chapter. Until
the close of the eighteenth century the resistance to the progress
of a ship was regarded as a single, uncompounded element, plainly
enough varying with the vessel&#8217;s speed and size. It was Marc
Beaufoy, who first in 1793 in London, pointed out that a ship&#8217;s
resistance has two distinct components; first, friction of the shell
or skin with the water through which the vessel moves, dependent
upon the area of that skin; second, resistance due to the formation
of waves as the ship advances, dependent upon the speed of
the vessel and the shape of her hull. Other resistances have since
been detected, but these two are much the most important of all;
each varies independently of the other as one ship differs from
another in form, or as in the same ship one speed is compared with
another. To take a simple case: a ship&#8217;s model of a certain form,
of perfectly clean skin, is towed at various speeds and the pull of
the tow-line is noted; then the same model with its skin roughened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and covered with marine growths is towed at the same
speeds, and much greater pulls are observed in the tow-line. The
wetted surface is the same in the two series of experiments, the
speeds correspond throughout, and the increase of resistance due
to a roughening of surface can only mean that the friction between
the water and the submerged skin has increased. Next we
take a model of certain form and definite size, and a second model
having the same area of wetted surface but a different form;
we tow both models at the same speed to find that one requires a
decidedly stronger pull than the other. This difference cannot
be due to frictional resistance of surface, for this is the same in
both models, therefore it must be due to the increased resistance
offered by the water as it is pushed aside, a resistance measurable
in the created waves. Mr. Edmund Froude, an eminent English
authority, says:</p>

<p>&#8220;For a ship A, of the ocean mail steamer type, 300 feet long
and 31<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> feet beam and 2,634 tons displacement, going at 13
knots an hour, the skin resistance is 5.8 tons, and the wave resistance
3.2 tons, making a total of 9 tons. At 14 knots the skin
resistance is but little increased, namely 6.6 tons; while the wave
resistance is nearly double, namely, 6.15 tons. Mark how great,
relatively to the skin resistance, is the wave resistance at the
moderate speed of 14 knots for a ship of this size and of 2,634
tons weight or displacement. In the case of another ship B, 300
feet long, 46.3 feet beam, and 3,626 tons displacement&mdash;a broader
and larger ship with no parallel middle body, but with fine lines
swelling out gradually&mdash;the wave resistance is much more
favorable.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
At 13 knots the skin resistance is rather more than
in the case of the other ship, being 6.95 tons as against 5.8 tons;
while the wave resistance is only 2.45 tons as against 3.2 tons.
At 14 knots there is a very remarkable result in this broader ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
with its fine lines, all entrance and run and no parallel middle
body<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>at 14 knots the skin resistance is 8 tons as against 6.6
tons in ship A, while the wave resistance is only 3.15 tons as compared
with 6.15 tons. The two resistances added together are
for B only 11.15 tons, while for A, a smaller ship, they amount to
12.75 tons.&#8221;</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
The entrance is that part of the ship forward where it enters the water
and swells out to the full breadth of the ship; the run is the after part
from where the ship begins to narrow and extending to the stern. A
ship may consist of only entrance and run; it may have a middle body
of parallel sides between the entrance and run. Such a middle body is
discussed by Lord Kelvin in &#8220;Popular Lectures and Addresses,&#8221; Vol. III,
Navigation, p. 492.</p></div>

<h3>Experimental Basins.</h3>

<p>These figures show that a designer must bear in mind the speed
at which this ship is to run; they prove that he may choose one
form to minimize friction, or another form if
he particularly wishes to bring wave-making
resistance to the lowest possible point. Forms
of these two kinds are readily studied when represented in models
12 to 20 feet in length towed through tanks built for the purpose.
Experiments of this kind were undertaken as long ago as 1770, in
the Paris Military School; the methods then inaugurated and
copied in London at the Greenland Docks were greatly improved
by Mr. William Froude in a tank which he constructed at Torquay
in England, in 1870. His modes of investigation, duly
adopted by the British Admiralty, and after his death continued
by his son, Mr. Edmund Froude, have created a new era in ship
design. To-day in Europe and America there are eleven such
tanks as Mr. Froude&#8217;s, all larger than his and more elaborate in
their appliances. In addition to learning the behavior of models
diverse in type, Mr. Froude worked out the rules which subsist
between the performance of a model and that of a ship of like
form; these he brought to proof in 1871 when he towed Her
Majesty&#8217;s Ship Greyhound, and verified his estimates in towing
its model. The rules concerned, known as those of mechanical
similitude, are given in detail by Professor Cecil H. Peabody in
his &#8220;Naval Architecture,&#8221; page 410. While experiments become
more and more valuable as one refinement succeeds another, there
is always much well worth knowing to be learned from the actual
behavior of a vessel as she takes her way through a canal, a shallow
river, or the storm-beaten stretches of the sea.</p>

<p>The experimental tank of the United States Navy at Washington,
is 470 feet long, 44 broad, and 14<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> deep; it is arranged
for models 20 feet in length. See the page opposite. The
towing carriage is a bridge spanning the tank just above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
water; it is a riveted steel girder. The towing mechanism, of
massive proportions, is driven by four electric motors of abundant
power. A double set of brakes brings the carriage gradually and
quietly to rest from a high speed. A self-acting recorder measures
both speed and resistance. Ship builders may have models
built by the Bureau in charge, that of Construction and Repair
of the United States Navy Department, and have these models
towed at any desired speeds, paying simple cost.</p>

</div>

<p>It was in 1880 that the lessons of towing experiments with
models began to be adopted in practice. As a result the forms
of steamers have been greatly improved. Originally their lines
were taken from those of sailing vessels but, as dimensions grew
bolder and speeds were increased, it became clear that steamers
demanded wholly different lines of their own. These lines, fortunately,
may be plainly disclosed in experiments with a model,
because a steamer usually runs on an even keel, in which position
a model is easily driven through a tank. A sailing vessel, on the
contrary, is nearly always heeled over by the wind so that it seldom
runs on an even keel; tank experiments, therefore, avail but
little for the improvement of its lines. Even were the model inclined
at various angles in one test after another, sails must be
omitted, with their influence on steering, their lifting and burying
effects, often extreme.</p>

<h3>A Viking Ship a Thousand Years Old.</h3>

<p>A thousand years ago the Vikings of Norway roved the seas
in boats of a form which is admired to-day. To those hardy adventurers
swiftness and seaworthiness meant
nothing less than life and victory, their eyes
perforce were keen to note what craft sped
fastest through the water, what new curves
kept waves from coming aboard. Perchance as they refined upon
keel and rib they took golden hints from the shapes of gulls and
fish. To be sure, long before science was dreamt of, they had to
work by rule-of-thumb, but the thumb was joined to brains that
did honor to human nature. On page 56 is illustrated the <a href="#Fig69">Viking
Ship</a> unearthed early in 1880 at Godstad, near Sandefjord in Norway,
in a mound where, according to tradition, a king and his
treasure had been buried. It is the most complete and the best
preserved vessel of ancient date in existence. It is fully described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56"
id="Page_56">[56-<br />57]</a><br /><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span>
and pictured in &#8220;The Viking Ship,&#8221; by Mr. N. Nicolaysen, a
work published in 1882 by Mr. Albert Cammermeyer, Christiania.
Mr. Nicolaysen regards the vessel as having been built about A. D.
900, for use in war by the great chieftain whose tomb it became.
The ship was 65 feet, 10 inches long, on the keel; with
an extreme length over all of 78 feet, 1 inch; amidships it was
16 feet, 9 inches; its depth amidships from the top of the bulwarks
to the keel was 3 feet, 11<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches. The material throughout
was pine. The helm, a plank shaped like a broad oar, was
fastened to the side of the vessel. In accordance with the number
of its oars and shields this ship must have had a crew of sixty-four,
besides these came the steersman, the chieftain and probably
a few more of his companions, making a total, in all likelihood,
of seventy to be carried by her. Says Mr. Nicolaysen: &#8220;In
the opinion of experts this must be deemed a masterpiece of its
kind, not to be surpassed by aught which the shipbuilding craft
of the present age could produce. Doubtless, in the ratio of our
present ideas, this is rather a boat than a ship; nevertheless in its
symmetrical proportions, and the eminent beauty of its lines, is
exhibited a perfection never attained until after a long and dreary
period of clumsy unshapeliness, when it was once more revived
in the clipper-built craft of the nineteenth century.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_5"

<h3>Clipper Ships and Modern Steamers.</h3>

<p>Thirty to sixty years ago much of the world&#8217;s commerce was
borne by clipper ships. In all likelihood as good lines as ever
went into a vessel of this kind were displayed
in the <a href="#Fig70">Young America</a>, outlined on page 58,
built in 1853 for California and East India
trade. She once ran from New York to San Francisco in 103
days, and from San Francisco to New York in 63 days, records
which have never been excelled. Her deck length was 235 feet;
her depth of hold 25 feet, 9 inches; her moulded beam was 40
feet, 2 inches; her displacement was 2,713 tons. The lines
worthiest of remark in her design are the diagonals and buttocks,
together with her easy entrance and run. Most clipper ships were
fuller forward than aft; this had two advantages: first, when
forward burdens, anchors and the like, tended to an undue settling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58"
id="Page_58">[58-<br />59]</a><br /><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></span>
down at the head, it was well to increase the buoyancy forward;
second, towing experiments prove that a form slightly fuller forward
than aft offers less resistance than the reverse. This shape
was hit upon by the old-time designers, doubtless as a result of
many a shrewd experiment.</p>

<p>In the early days of steamships, hollow or somewhat concave
water lines forward were in favor. Experiments with models
have demonstrated that for boats so full in section as to be nearly
square, it is best to have forward lines which are straight or nearly
so. Recently it has been shown that at high speeds, with a midship
section nearly semicircular, resistance is a little lessened
by very slightly hollowing the water lines forward.</p>

<p>If a steamer is to have the utmost speed, as the <a href="#Fig71">Kaiser Wilhelm
II</a>, outlined on page 60, her design will be very unlike that
of a vessel required to carry as much cargo as possible at a
moderate or low speed, as in the case of the <a href="#Fig72">steamship</a> sketched
on page 61. The dimensions of the Kaiser Wilhelm II are<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>length
over all, 706<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> feet; beam, 72 feet; depth, 29 feet, 6<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>
inches; displacement, 29,000 tons; speed, 23<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> knots; indicated
horse power, 38,000. As we compare with her details of form
the general features of our cargo carrier, page 61, we observe in
this freighter the full form of its water lines, its almost straight
and blunt entrance forward; we also notice that the lower part
of the bow has been cut away to avoid a reversal of curves which
would create an eddy with its consequent increase of resistance.
Further we may remark the squareness of the midship section,
which means carrying capacity at its maximum, together with
the long parallel middle body, little resisted by the water, ending
aft in buttocks and water-lines quickly turned. This is a twin-screw
ship: of length 358 feet, 2 inches; beam, 46 feet; draft,
23 feet; depth from shelter deck, 34 feet, 8 inches; displacement,
8,270 tons; speed, 9 to 10 knots.</p>

<p>A good designer has an easy task in drawing lines for a
freighter in which the weight of hull, machinery and coals may
be only 40 per cent. of the displacement, leaving 60 per cent. for
earning space. Contrast this with an Atlantic flyer, where but
5 per cent. may remain for cargo. Here the designer&#8217;s problems
are difficult indeed, and the chief way out of them is to enlarge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60"
id="Page_60">[60-<br />63]</a><br /><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><br /><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><br /><a
name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></span>
his ship as much as he dares, for the bigger his vessel, its form
and speed unchanged, the less will be its resistance as compared
with displacement. But to an increase of size there are hard and
fast bounds; first, those imposed by the shallowness of channels
and harbors; while the depth of a ship is thus restricted, its length
may be somewhat extended with safety and gain; to increase of
beam there are distinct and moderate limits, to overpass them
means that the ship will follow the wave contour of a heavy sea
so closely as to have a quick, jerky and dangerous motion.</p>

<h3>Judgment in Ship Design.</h3>

<p>To design a ship in this case and every other is plainly a matter
of compromise, a quest of the optimum by a balancing of demands
for safety, strength, speed, capacity, handiness,
good behavior in a sea-way, so that each invested
dollar may in the long run earn the
largest return possible. Excellent examples of judicious design are
the best passenger steamers plying between Europe and New York.
Usually their section amidships is like that of a cargo vessel, but
for a special reason. Within the freighter&#8217;s walls the greatest
feasible cross-section must be created; so that the shape is box-like;
in a high-speed passenger ship the form is also square, because
harbors are shallow; were they less shallow the designer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
would choose a midship section somewhat semicircular in contour.
Were our harbors deepened, the easy sections of the first
transatlantic steamers could be repeated in their gigantic successors
of to-day, with increased speed for each horse power
employed.</p>

<p>What a designer can do when his aim is swiftness at the expense
of all other considerations, is shown in the lines of the
torpedo-boat destroyer, page 62. Its length over all is 246 feet;
length at water level, 240 feet, 10 inches; beam, 22 feet, 3 inches;
mean draft, 6 feet, 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches; displacement, 489 tons; speed,
30 knots. It is interesting to contrast, on page 63, the <a href="#Fig74">cross-section</a>

typical vessels described in this chapter.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
FORM&mdash;<i>Continued</i>. SHAPES TO LESSEN RESISTANCE
TO MOTION</h2>

<p class="chaptoc">Shot formed to move swiftly through the air .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Railroad trains and
automobiles of somewhat similar shape .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Toothed wheels, conveyors,
propellers and turbines all so curved as to move with utmost freedom.</p>

<h3>Projectiles and Vehicles of Like Pattern.</h3>

<p class="chapstart">While ships are much the largest structures built for
motion, and therefore meet resistances which the designer
must lessen as best he may, other moving bodies, small as compared
with ships, encounter resistances so extreme that their reduction
enlists the utmost skill and the most
careful study. Speeds vastly higher than those
of ships are given to projectiles. A ball leaving
a gun muzzle with a velocity of 3,410 feet
a second, as at Sandy Hook in January, 1906, suffers great atmospheric
resistance, overcome in part by the shot having a
tapering or conoidal form. Indians long ago stuck feathers
obliquely into arrows so as to keep flight true to its aim by giving
shafts a spiral motion; an attendant advantage being to lengthen
flight. The same principle appears in rifling, that is, in cutting
spiral grooves in the barrels of firearms large and small, a missile
receiving a spinning motion through its base, a thin protruding
disk of soft metal, forced into the grooves by the explosive.
At first the grooves in firearms were straight with intent
to preclude fouling; spiral grooves were introduced by
Koster of Birmingham about 1620. Delvigne, a Frenchman, devised
a lengthened bullet narrower than the bore so as to enter
freely, under the pressure of firing it completely filled the bore,
rotating with great velocity as it sped forth.</p>

<p class="caption">Racing automobile. Wedge front and spokeless wheels.</p>
</div>

<p>Now that railroad speeds are approaching those of projectiles,
the outlines of trains are resembling those of shot and shell. In
the experiments with very fast trains at Zossen, in Germany,
October, 1903, each car had a paraboloidal front, much diminishing
the resistance of the air. Racing automobiles are usually encased
in a pointed shell which parts the air like a wedge; their
wheels, too, are supported not by spokes, but by disks having no
projections. As electric traction becomes more and more rapid
in its interurban services, the cars will undoubtedly be shaped to
lessen atmospheric resistance. Especially is this desirable in a
tunnel service, such as that of the New York Subway, where the
resistances are extreme for the same reason that a boat in a canal
is harder to draw than if in water both broad and deep. Just as
in ship-design, it is in sharpening the front and rear of a car or
a train that most economy is feasible; the friction at the sides cannot
be much lessened except, in the case of a train, by joining
each car to the next by a vestibule such as that of the Pullman
Company.</p>

<p>Electric traction finds gain in a track having in places a decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
inclination. In the monorail line between Liverpool and Manchester
a downward dip in the line at each terminal quickens departure,
and in arrival aids the brakes by checking speed on the
up-grade. In the swift motion of ordinary machinery the resistance
of the air is a source of considerable loss. By encasing a
heavy flywheel in sheet iron so as to present a smooth surface to
the atmosphere, M. Ingliss has saved 4.8 per cent. of the energy
of a 630 horse power engine.</p>

</div>

<h3>Gearing: Conveyors.</h3>

<p>In the simplest machines motion may be transmitted by wheels
in contact, faced with adhesive leather, rubber, or cloth. Teeth,
however, are usually employed; as wear takes
place they permit a little play, a slight looseness,
which contact wheels altogether refuse.
Toothed wheels have the further advantage that they do not slip,
their motion is positive. How teeth may best be contoured involves
nice questions in geometry.
They should always
push and never grind each
other, and should move with
the least possible friction. In
some ingenious designs the
teeth of any one particular
wheel of a series will enmesh
with the teeth of any other
wheel, no matter how much
larger or smaller. Bevel gears
cut by Mr. Hugo Bilgram, of
Philadelphia, turn with hardly
any friction whatever, although
in some wheels the
teeth run askew, or are sections
of cones which do not
meet at their apices. The Bilgram
gear cutter, and the Fellows&#8217; gear shaper which turns out
plain gear, exert a to and fro planing action. Ordinary gears are
cut on milling machines by rotary cutters, or may be manufactured
on a Bliss press without cutting the original lines of fibre. The
importance of accurate and easy-running gears increases steadily;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
they are, for example, applied to steam turbines whose velocity
must be reduced in the actuation of ordinary machines. Automobiles
and bicycles also demand reducing gear running with
the utmost freedom.</p>

<p>The grain elevator, invented many years ago, is the parent of
manifold conveyors of coal, lime, ore or aught else. Their receivers
have links shaped so as to extend for hundreds of feet
as continuous belts. Link belting may be had in detachable sections,
fitting each other at secure hinges which allow free motion.</p>

<p>The <i>Augustin B. Wolvin</i>, a typical ore-carrier on the great
lakes, is 56 feet in depth;
its hold is curved to allow a
clam-shaped bucket to seize
ten tons of ore at each dip.
It is probable that at no
distant day rapid transit in
cities will employ continuous
moving platforms,
just as conveyors and telpherage
systems are taking
the place of the discontinuous
transport of grain,
coal, cotton, ore, and heavy merchandise.</p>

<h3>Propellers.</h3>

<p>The screw, an inclined plane wound about an axis, forms the
propeller for steamships and many steamboats. There is a good
deal of debate as to the principles which should
decide its best lines. Here evidently is a field
which will handsomely repay thorough investigation.
The power expended in steamships, whether fast
or slow, is prodigious; any marked improvement in the contour
of screws will mean either a saving of fuel or an increase of
speed. Of equal importance with water-propulsion is the setting
in motion of air. In blast furnaces enormous volumes of air are
forced at high pressure into the fuel and ore: the fans are carefully
molded in screw form, any departure from the best curves
entailing serious loss. Fans for less important services are seldom
shaped with care and usually waste much energy.</p>

<h3>Turbines.</h3>

<p>Allied to screws are turbine wheels, much the most efficient of
water motors. The shaping of their vanes as volutes minimizes
the loss of energy in shock as the water comes
in, and lessens to the utmost the velocity of
the stream as it leaves the wheel. Now that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
steam turbines are scoring a success both on land and sea the
contouring of their vanes with extreme nicety is an important
problem of the engineer. A
perfected form means the
highest economy.</p>

</div>

<p>It is interesting to note
how the screw propeller, the
fan, and the turbine wheel
have each led to a converse
invention. Mr. Edwin Reynolds,
of Milwaukee, has
devised a pump in screw
form of capital efficiency
under low heads. The fan
has long had its converse
in the windmill, now more
popular throughout America
than ever before, mainly
because shaped with new
excellence. In the best
models, built of steel, the
sails are each a section of a
volute carefully designed
to discharge the wind
evenly, just as in the parallel case of emission from a water
mover, such as the Worthington pump. This capital pump is
simply a turbine wheel reversed. Its impeller and diffusion vanes
take up water from rest, lift it to a height which may be as much
as 2,000 feet, and then deliver it at rest, with little loss from internal
eddies or slippage.</p>

<h3>A Shrewd Observer Improves Windows.</h3>

<p class="chapstart">These are times when an inheritance, such as the window
pane, venerable though it be, is freely criticized and shown
to be far from perfect. We find, indeed, that surfaces and forms
long given to the glass through which light passes, or from which
light is reflected, are faulty and wasteful. This
means that sunshine can be turned to better account
than ever before, that artificial light can
be employed with an economy wholly new. A
few years ago when we provided a window with plate glass,
smooth enough for a mirror, nothing better seemed possible.
Thanks to the late Edward Atkinson, of Boston, we know to-day
that in many cases glass may be too smooth to give us the best
service, that often we may get much more light from panes of
rough, cheap make than from costly plate glass. He tells us:
&#8220;In 1883, when I inspected a large number of English cotton
mills, I found them glazed with rough glass of rather poor quality,
the common glass of England being inferior to our own from
the general lack of good sand. On asking why rough glass was
used instead of smooth I was told that rough glass gave a uniform
and better light. To my astonishment I found this true. The
interior of a mill so lighted had the aspect of diffused illumination.
This led me to reason on the subject. I looked into the construction
of the Fresnel lens, in which a combination of lenses and
curved surfaces concentrates rays of light into a single far reaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
beam. I reasoned that if one set of angles or curves could
thus concentrate light, then by reversal of such angles or surfaces,
light could be diffused.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Atkinson proceeded to gather specimens of glass not only
of common rough surface, but also in ribbed and prismatic
forms. These he handed for examination and comparison to
Professor Charles L. Norton of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Boston. His report says: &#8220;The hopelessness of
trying to get something for nothing, that is, to get a sheet of
window glass to throw into a room more light than fell upon it,
appeared so plain to me that I made all my preparations to measure
not a gain but a loss of light in using Mr. Atkinson&#8217;s samples.
The results of the tests may be briefly stated: In a room thirty
feet or more deep we may increase the light to from three to fifteen
times its present effect by using &#8216;Factory Ribbed&#8217; glass instead
of plane glass in the upper sash. By using prisms we may,
under certain conditions, increase the effective light to fifty times
its present strength. The gain in effective light on substituting
ribbed glass or prisms for plane glass is much greater when the
sky-angle is small, as in the case of windows opening upon light
shafts or narrow alleys. With the use of prisms a desk fifty feet
from a window has been better lighted than when but twenty feet
from the same window fitted with plane glass. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#8216;Ribbed&#8217;
and &#8216;Maze&#8217; glass are of very great value in softening the light,
especially when windows are directly exposed to the sun, aside
from their effectiveness in strengthening the light at distant
points. With the &#8216;Maze&#8217; glass the artist may have, in all weathers
and in all directions, what is in effect a much-desired north light.
The same glass provides the photographer with light as well
diffused as when cloth screens or shades are employed and of
much greater intensity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Plate prism glass is now manufactured with its outer or street
surface ground and polished like plate glass, with its prisms accurate
and smooth. In dimensions which may reach fifty-four by
sixty inches it affords surfaces easily kept clean, and transmitting
much more light than glass held in frames of small divisions.</p>

<p>Whence the gain in thus exchanging plane glass for glass
rough, ribbed, or prismatic? Rays streaming through an ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
window strike nearby surfaces of wall, ceiling, and floor; from
these they are reflected in large measure and return through the
glass to outer space.
Rough, ribbed, or prismatic
glass throws the rays much
further into the room, hence
they strike so much larger
an area of wall, ceiling, and
floor that in being reflected
again and again the light
is well diffused, and but little
is sent forth again into
outside space. The form
of the glass gives the entering
light its most useful direction,
so that the new
panes serve better than the
old. This effect is most
striking when prisms are carefully adapted to a particular case in
both their angles and their placing. In traversing glass, light is
absorbed and wasted, so that the shorter its path the better. In
the compound lens devised in 1822 for lighthouses by Augustin
Jean Fresnel, light is as effectively bent by the part of the glass
shown in dark lines as if the whole lens were employed.</p>

<img src="images/illo106b.png" alt="" width="450" height="94" />
<p class="caption">Fresnel lens.</p>
</div>

<p>This brings us to means for the best use of artificial light.
Within the past thirty years the standard of illumination, thanks
to electricity, has steadily risen. More important than ever, therefore,
is it that light should be employed pleasantly and effectively.
This in the main is a question of placing the sources of light
judiciously, and of so reflecting and refracting their rays that
they will be of agreeable quality, and arrive where they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
wanted with the least possible loss. Reflectors rightly shaped and
kept clean economize much light. For lack of them in streets and
squares we may sometimes observe half the rays from a lamp
taking their way to the sky where they do no good. In shop windows
ribbed reflectors throw full illumination on the wares displayed,
while the sources of light
are out of view. The same method
is employed in art galleries
and in museums. A parabolic
reflector sends forth as parallel
rays the powerful beam of a lighthouse,
a locomotive, or a searchlight.
An incandescent lamp of ingenious
design is silvered on its
upper half so that none of its light
is wasted. Because the arc lamp is
the cheapest of all illuminants it is
adopted for out-of-door lighting where its unpleasant glare is tempered
by distance. In factory lighting its brightness is excessive and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
harmful unless moderated. A capital plan is to employ an ordinary
continuous current and place the positive carbon, with its brilliant
centre, below the negative carbon; beneath these two carbons a
good reflector throws the rays to the ceiling, whence they descend
with agreeable diffusion and much less loss than when globes of
ground glass surround the arc. A common white ceiling when
quite flat is an excellent reflector; indeed, a sheet of white blotting
paper returns light nearly as well as a polished mirror, and for
many purposes it serves better; the mirror sends back its beam in a
sharply defined area which may be dazzling, the paper scatters
light with thorough and agreeable effect.</p>

</div>

<p>Usually a mirror is a sheet of highly polished metal, or a plate
of glass with a quicksilver backing; preferable to either is clear
glass, all by itself, so formed as totally to reflect an impinging
beam of light. To understand the principle involved in its use we
will for a little while bid good-by to lamps of all kinds.</p>

<h3>Delight and Gain as We Watch a Fish in Water.</h3>

<p>A hall of delights is the New York Aquarium, in the historic
Castle Garden at the Battery. Its tanks display a varied and
superb collection of fish, whose beauty of form
and color heightened by swift and graceful
motion, fascinates the eye as no museum of
dead things, however splendid, ever does. When
a tank is still, or nearly still, and a gold-fish or
a perch is quietly resting near the surface of the water, one may
see its form reflected from that surface as perfectly as if by a
mirror. The point of view must be close to the tank, with the eye
somewhat lower than the fish. So perfect, at times, is this mirroring
that young folks are apt to suppose the reflection to be
a second fish, and they are puzzled to remark how strangely it
resembles its mate just below. What explains this reflection? A
ray of light can always pass from a rare medium, such as air, into
a dense medium, such as water, because it is bent toward their
common perpendicular. But a ray cannot always pass from a
dense into a rare medium, from, let us say, water into air, for if
the ray were to be bent away from the common perpendicular
more than 90&deg; it would altogether fail to emerge from the water.
No luminous ray can pass from water into air if it makes a
greater angle with the perpendicular than 48&deg; 35&acute;. Suppose AB<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
(<a href="#Page_78">page 78</a>) to be the water level of a tank. A ray leaving F will be
bent so as to reach C, a ray from G will reach D, a ray from H
will reach E; but a ray from L will be bent so much as to pass
along the surface of the water as OB, and a ray from I will be
bent so as to return beneath the surface of the water to I. Rays
such as I, undergoing total reflection, afford us our second image
of a fish at rest near the surface of water: to observe this kind of
image we need not journey to the New York Aquarium; with
patience we may behold it in a small home aquarium with flat
sides of clear glass, waiting until the water is quiet and a fish
comes close to the surface.</p>

<img src="images/illo109.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="361" />
<p class="caption">Sacramento perch totally reflected in aquarium.<br />
A, surface of water.</p>
</div>

<p>Every dense transparent substance has this ability to yield
images by total reflection, each substance having a critical angle
of its own; we have just seen that for water this angle is 48&deg; 35&acute;.
Glass is made in many varieties, each with a special critical angle,
never much different from that of water. A right-angled prism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of glass, which any optician can supply, serves as a capital mirror
for rays striking its surface at ninety degrees. Such prisms are
employed in opera glasses, in hand telescopes, in reflectors for
light-houses, and in the Holophane globes we are about to
examine. The efficiency of these prisms may be as much as 92
per cent., whereas that of the best silvered mirrors never exceeds
90 per cent. The loss in a prism is due to a slight reflection by
the surface on which the rays first fall, and by the absorption of
light in the glass itself; this second loss, of course, increases with
the thickness of the prism.</p>

<h3>Total Reflection in Artificial Lighting: Holophane Globes.</h3>

<p>Now that we understand the principle of total reflection, let us
see how it is applied to increasing the effectiveness of a Welsbach
mantle or an electric lamp. And first let
us say that we may wish light upon a small
area, mainly in a single direction, as downward
upon a desk or reading-chair. Or, in a quite
different manner, if we are to illuminate a wide
space such as that of a large parlor. These requirements are
fulfilled by the Holophane globes, devised by M. Blondel and M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Psaroudaki, which are made in many shapes, each adapted to a
specific duty. The upper
half of each globe is
formed into prisms of such
angles that, zone by zone,
the glass totally reflects impinging
rays in just the directions
desired. The contouring
is accurate to the
thousandth part of an inch.
With this thorough reflection
is combined diffusion
as thorough, the interior of
the globe being shaped as
ribs. Thus, with the least
possible waste, the upper
half of the source of light
is utilized. What of the lower half? Its rays pass through prisms
formed so as to refract impinging light into desired paths with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
but little loss. As a whole, therefore, these globes furnish a beautiful
means of illumination with all but perfect economy, special
forms of them sending light in any direction desired.</p>

<h3>Total Reflection in Binocular Glasses.</h3>

<p>In the Zeiss Works at Jena, in Germany, optical instruments
of the highest excellence are manufactured; many of these take
advantage of the principle of total reflection we
have been considering. When the task was
assumed of producing a new and improved
telescope, it was observed that an ordinary
telescope, built up of lenses, is inconveniently long and heavy in
comparison with its magnifying power. The question arose
whether it was possible to construct short instruments of a magnifying
power of four to twelve diameters. Porro, an Italian, about
the middle of the nineteenth
century suggested totally reflecting
prisms so placed that
while the total travel of a ray
would be the same as in an
ordinary telescope, the two
ends of the luminous path would be near together, while the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
would be more effective than if four mirrors were employed.
His idea may be represented
by a wire one meter
long so bent that its ends
are much less than one
meter apart. In an illustration
of a field-glass as
manufactured at the Zeiss
Works, on the Porro principle,
it will be remarked
that the entering ray
passes through lenses which are farther apart than the lenses
which form the eye-pieces. Thus a much wider field is viewed
than that of an ordinary glass, while as the two images received
from the two eye-pieces differ more than those observed in direct
vision, the perception of depth is increased in a notable degree.
This construction is adapted to sporting, marine, and opera-glasses,
as well as to field-glasses.</p>

<h3>Lenses Still Much Used.</h3>

<p>Lenses nevertheless continue to be much more important than
prisms, and the proper shaping of their surfaces involves high
reaches of both science and art. The properties
of the glass, of course, count for most in producing
combinations free from color for telescopes,
microscopes, and cameras. <a href="#Page_180">Jena glass</a>, described in another
chapter of this book, with its extraordinary range of refractive
and dispersive qualities has brought optical instruments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
to virtual perfection. Meanwhile the arts of lens-grinding leave
little to be expected in the way of future improvement. It is
astonishing that a lens forty-two inches wide can be so truly
curved as to focus the image of a star as an immeasurable dot.</p>

</div>

<h3>The Production of Optical Surfaces.</h3>

<p>Let us look at some of the instruments designed by a master for
shaping glass discs into lenses. Some of the best telescopes
in existence are from the hands of Mr. John
A. Brashear, of Allegheny, Pennsylvania.
The grinding tools he employs he has contoured
in such wise as to produce desired
curves free from error. The first polishers are of the ordinary
form with square or circular facets equally distributed over the
surface of the tool, as in <a href="#Fig97">Figs.</a> H and 8. When the polish is
brought to its best, the glass is allowed to cool slowly to a normal
temperature, and is then carefully studied as to its defects. These
are removed and the surfaces finished with iron tools, of the same
diameter as the surface to be worked, each tool being laid off into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
six sections, as in Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The tool being warmed,
pitch is spread over its leaf-like spaces, which are given the proper
curve by being pressed down on the previously wetted concave
surface; the pitch and tool are next quickly cooled with water.
In the shaping of these spaces rests success. The zone, a, a, in
the first figure, needing the greatest amount of abrasion, meets
the widest part of the leaflet, but in order that no zonal error may
be introduced, as in b, c, c, b, of the second figure, it is gently
tapered in each direction, the amount of taper being governed by
the lateral stroke given to the polisher, as well as by the amount
of departure of the zone from the normal curve.</p>

<p>But after all the astronomers aided by lenses thus carefully
shaped are few, while millions of people suffer from defects of
sight which are overcome by suitably formed spectacles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<h3>Bi-focal Spectacles.</h3>

<p>In this field a recent minor improvement is worthy of mention.
Benjamin Franklin many years ago made a pair of spectacles in
which the upper half of each glass was ground
for far seeing, the lower half for near seeing.
To-day such bi-focal spectacles are not made in
halves, with an unpleasant broken line across them. In each of
the new eyeglasses toward the base a small lens of dense quality
is enclosed; through this lens a wearer looks at objects nearby;
through the upper part of the eyeglass he looks at distant objects.
The joining of the three parts is effected so skilfully as not to be
discernible.</p>

</div>

<h3>Economy of Heat.</h3>

<p>From light we pass to its twin phase of energy, heat, for a
glance at the forms of devices which enable us to use heat with
economy. When we wish a furnace, crucible,
or cooking vessel to maintain the highest possible
temperature, we give it as little surface
as possible. On the contrary when a warming apparatus is devised,
its surface is freely extended. The traditional fireplace,
for all its cheerfulness, yields but little heat. Benjamin Franklin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
copied its form in the stove which bears his name; as it stands
out from a wall it warms the air all around itself, instead of on
one side only. This model is
familiar in gas stoves, whose
heat thoroughly radiated and
convected far exceeds that derived
from fireplaces. In
Canada forty years ago it was
usual, especially in the country,
to set up gallows-pipes
and dumb-stoves, or drums,
bulky, hollow structures of
sheet iron, which obliged the
heated products of combustion
to take a roundabout course as
they passed to the chimney.
To be sure as thus cooled the
gases were less effective as
draft makers, but we must remember
that one of the most
wasteful uses of fire is in
warming air or other gases
for the sake of putting them in motion. In modern factories, central
lighting stations, and the like huge installations, mechanical
draft sends a quick current through a short
chimney, saving much fuel. Excellent in design
are the tile stoves of Germany and Holland.
Their gentle heat does not parch the
air; in moderately cold weather they render it
unnecessary to light furnaces which develop,
at such times, unduly high temperatures.</p>

<div class="figc300" id="Fig99">
<img src="images/illo118a.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="426" />
<p class="caption">Canadian box stove with gallows-pipe.</p>
</div>

<p>In factories the heating coils filled with
steam or hot water were at first fastened to
the floor. Then came attaching them to the
ceiling whence their heat is gently radiated;
on the floor the coils may gather dust and dirt
with risk of fire; with the other plan there is
a saving of floor space, and accidental leaks
are at once in evidence.</p>

<div class="figc250" id="Fig100">

dumb-stove.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Tubes for warming are specially effective when dented or
buckled in directions at right angles to each other and to the axis
of the tube. This form gives the heating water or steam a swirling
motion which causes it to part more rapidly with its heat than
does a cylindrical tube of the same surface. Gold&#8217;s electric heater
for street-cars, bath-rooms, and the like, is a spiral of resistant
alloy, hung in a light metallic frame, the whole presenting a large
surface to the air. Automobiles driven by heat engines require
coils of the utmost possible surface whereat cooling can take
place; in many cases this cooling is furthered by the action of a
quick fan. In like manner the condensers of steam-engines, especially
aboard ship, are made up of slender tubes presenting to
the steam a chilling area of vast extent.</p>

<p>Inventors have long addressed themselves to the difficulty
caused by the expansion and contraction of structures as temperatures
change. For years the cylindrical fire-boxes of marine
boilers have been corrugated, so as to allow them a certain play
without breaking from their fastenings,
or tearing their seams, when
heated or cooled. This form is adopted
with success for the Morison fire-boxes
of the Vanderbilt locomotives.
In quite different situations metal
piping, in a length of let us say 100
feet, is provided against trouble from
shrinkage or expansion by a U bend.
When the diameter of the pipe is
twelve inches, this bend is usually
about ten feet in extent; for a six inch pipe, a bend six feet long
suffices. Another difficulty due to heat is the limitation of speed
imposed by the heat which friction creates. A new type of circular
saw has a hollow arbor through which flows cold water, so
that motion may be faster than ever before. The same arbor appears
in various other machines with like advantage.</p>

<h3>Tools and Implements.</h3>

<p class="chapstart">We have just reviewed, all too briefly, how light and heat are
economized by structures of judicious form. At this point
we will bestow a rapid glance at the economy of work as promoted
by sound design in tools and implements, in the machines which
embody these for tasks far beyond the personal
skill or power of the strongest and deftest
mechanic.</p>

<p>When of old a savage took up a stone to serve as a rude knife
or chisel, we may be sure that he chose the sharpest flint he could
find. If he could better its shape by knocking it into something
like a wedge, what task was easier? Our museums display an immense
variety of stone hammers, axes, knives, and arrowheads,
showing how art long ago improved the forms of simple tools and
weapons offered by nature. Modern tools and weapons, for all
their immense diversity, were every one prefigured in the rude
armory of primitive man.</p>

<p>Descended from his flint knife is the abounding variety of steel
cutting tools all the way from the razor, concave on both sides,
to the axe, doubly convex. As the arts have become more specialized,
as artificial power has been introduced, the contrasts of
the form of one tool with another have grown more and more
striking. The bar which slices metal is stout of build, and rectangular
in section, while a lancet is little wider or thicker than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
blade of grass. The knives
which divide leather, rubber,
and rope, differ much from
one another; the knife which
separates the leaves of a
book serves best when dull.
Gouges for carving are
nicely adapted to the profiles
they are to cut; while
the exigencies of the power-lathe
require its tools to
be designed of particular
strength and rigidity.
Among revolving hand-tools
the brace is the most important,
enabling the workman
to exert great leverage. A minor tool, the gimlet, was
formerly more in use than to-day. Now that screws are made
with gimlet points they break their own paths.</p>

<p>From the beginning tool-makers have shown skill in fitting a
tool to the hand, as in the Eskimo skin-scraper;
this simple adaptation may
have arrived in copying the effect of
wear. Other good hints have come
from observing an implement after its
work is done. At the places where
mud clung to a plowshare the plow-maker
was long ago told at what points
to raise his metal; conversely, when a
cutter of any kind is unduly worn at
any part of its side, there the metal
asks to be somewhat narrowed down.</p>

<h3>Annular Drills.</h3>

<p>A circle of say two feet in diameter, may be readily cut from a
boiler plate by two cutters, one at each end of a horizontal bar,
the bar being supported by a central upright
axis receiving the motive power. Because the
cut is narrow, but little metal is wasted as chips.
A cut of this ring-shape effects a desirable saving even when the
circle to be swept is but an inch or so in width instead of several
feet. When an auger takes
its way through a plank it
removes as chips all the
wood within the circle of
its range; a drill, of common
form, as it pierces
stone or metal acts in a
similar manner. Motive
power is greatly economized
when a drill is tubular,
with the further advantage
that within the
ring cut a solid cylinder remains
to be broken off at
intervals and lifted out, its
core informing to the engineer
in quest of bed-rock, to the prospector of mines or oil-fields,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
or to the geologist who reads at a glance the composition
of a mineral, the forces which have impressed it age after age.
Such drills, set with bortz diamonds, have accomplished remarkable
feats. In boring out 260 columns surrounding the dome of
the capitol at Springfield, Illinois, cores 22<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches in diameter
were removed from holes 24 inches wide; without sacrifice of
strength there was a saving in weight of three-fifths. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Ellenwood coal mine, Kingston, Pennsylvania, a core 17 feet, 5
inches in breadth was taken from a bore only five inches wider.
When the engineers in 1896 were planning the foundations for
the Williamsburg Bridge, New York, the deepest of their 22
borings was 112 feet below high water. Steel drills had indicated
bed-rock 12 to 20 feet higher than was the actual case; the
diamond drill showed the supposed bed-rock to be merely a deposit
of boulders. No other known means could have accomplished
these results. In the same way steel guns of large calibre
have been drilled so as to leave a core of much value, while in this
as in all other such tasks, the boring demanded less energy and
proved less straining than if all the metal within the sweep of the
drill had been reduced to fragments. All these tools were prefigured
in a simple ring drill used two thousand years ago on
the banks of the Nile; hollow reeds were employed, with sand as
a cutter.</p>

<div class="figc150" id="Fig112">
<img src="images/illo125.png" alt="" width="150" height="328" />
<p class="caption">Twist drill.</p>
</div>

<h3>Twist Drills.</h3>

<p>Twist drills are superseding flat drills as stronger and better in
every way. A twist drill is made with a slight taper toward the
shank end. Its cross-section is
not quite round, the diameter
being reduced from a short distance
behind the cutting edge, so as to diminish
friction and give the sides of the drill as much
clearance as possible. The advanced edges of
the flutes are all full circle, so as to maintain the
diameter of the drill and keep the tool steady.
The advantage of the twist drill is that its cuttings
find free egress, while it always runs true, without
reforging or retempering. The cutting edges
are usually ground to an angle of sixty degrees
to the center line of the drill; for brass work the
angle should be fifty degrees.</p>

<h3>Lathe and Planer Tools.</h3>

<p>The manner in which a lathe tool cuts metal is shown in an
<a href="#Fig113">outline</a> which represents a tool feeding a cut along a piece of
wrought iron. The removed metal, in its diameter
and openness, tells the expert operator
both the quality of his cutter and how it is
being affected by wear. The principal consideration, says Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Joshua Rose, in determining the proper shape of a cutting tool,
for use in a lathe or a planer, is where it shall have the rake, or
inclination, to make it keen enough to cut well, and yet be as
strong as possible; this is governed, in a large degree, by the
nature of the work.</p>

<h3>Machine Tools: Lathes.</h3>

<p>In giving form to wood and metal cheaply and rapidly, machine-tools
have within recent years risen to great importance. Of
these the lathe is one of the chief. It seems
to be descended from the bow drill, the tool
which was whirled by a cord wrapped round it,
or it may be, that under another sky, the lathe was derived from
the potter&#8217;s wheel whose axle was changed from a vertical to a
horizontal plane. For centuries
all lathes had their cutting
tools simply laid on a bar,
or rest, just as in the hand
cutting lathe of to-day. While
this afforded opportunity to
skill it did not lend itself to
large or uniform production.
Henry Maudslay, about a century
ago, immensely broadened
the machine in scope by
devising the slide rest which
firmly grasps the cutting tool,
and automatically moves it toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
or away from the axis of the work, as well as along the work
in any desired line. This device is equally applicable whether in
turning a pencil case, the granite columns for a cathedral, or the
propeller-shaft of an ocean steamer.</p>

<p>The lathe has been developed in many ways until it has become
one of the most complex of all machines, adapted to tasks which
even twenty years ago seemed impossible. Only two of its varieties
can here be noticed, the Blanchard lathe for cutting irregular
forms, and the turret lathe. An illustration, taken from an old
engraving shows the Blanchard lathe as originally built for shoe-lasts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
A pattern-last and the block to be carved are fixed on the
same axis and are revolved by a pulley. On a sliding carriage
are fastened pivots from which are freely suspended the axles of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
cutting wheel, and a friction wheel, equal in diameter. The cutting
wheel turns on a horizontal axle, and bears on its periphery a series
of cutters. The friction wheel is in contact with the pattern-last
and presses against it while in motion. During revolution, the
pattern, irregular in its surface, causes the axis to approach or
recede from this friction wheel; the cutting wheel in its corresponding
motion removes wood from the block until a duplicate of
the pattern appears. This lathe much improved
and modified now turns not only
gun-stocks, axe-handles and the like, but repeats
elaborate carvings with precision.
Ornaments for Pullman cars are produced
by this machine.</p>

<p>The turret lathe, equally ingenious, has a
turret or capstan, which carries let us say
eight different tools, one on each of its
eight faces. In its turn each tool operates
on the work in its forward traverse; it then
retires while the turret automatically moves
through one-eighth of a circle, when the
next tool emerges for its task, and so on.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> The turret principle is embodied in drills and a variety of other
machines. It was adopted in remarkable fashion by John Ericsson in his
Monitor, launched in 1862 for service in the Civil War. Because this
vessel had to navigate shallow streams, its draft was limited to eleven
feet. As it was thus impossible to carry the burden of armor necessary
to protect a high-sided vessel, he was obliged to design a sunken hull.
Guns and gunner were protected within a covered cylindrical turret which
as it turned on its vertical axis, delivered an all-round fire while the
Monitor stood still. Ericsson&#8217;s original turret, and its later modifications
in the leading navies of the world, are described in the Life of John
Ericsson, by William Conant Church, New York, Scribner, 1890.</p>

<p>Lathes have given rise to planers, now
built of great strength and in highly complicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
designs. In a lathe the object turns upon centers against
a tool; a planer carries its tool in a revolving cylinder, the work
being fed in a straight line. A shaper, with much the same essential
construction, moves along its work, the wood or metal operated
on remaining stationary. With a planer or a shaper the size and
uniformity of the work depend upon the skill of the operator. The
planer has led to the invention of a machine which dispenses with
this skill. Bramah, in 1811, employed a revolving cutter to plane
iron, adapting to metal the familiar mechanism for planing wood.
This was the beginning of the milling machine, now so remarkably
developed and improved. A skilled mechanic sets the machine
and the chucks which hold the work; an unskilled hand can
continue the operations, his products being uniformly of the dimensions
and forms desired. Intricate shapes are easily executed,
quite impracticable on any other machine. At first the revolving
mechanism and its cutters were a single piece of metal; to-day
cutters of costly quality are inserted in cheap metal; these inserted
cutters when worn out are easily replaced.</p>

<p>Now for a glimpse of what a great inventor
had to suffer because he lived prior
to the era of machine tools, before the days,
indeed, of that indispensable organ of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
lathe, its slide rest. The first steam engines of James Watt built
at the Soho Works, near Birmingham, are thus described<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;A
cast iron cylinder, over 18 inches
in diameter, an inch thick and
weighing half a ton, not perfect, but
without any gross error was procured,
and the piston, to diminish
friction and the consequent wear of
metal, was girt with a brass hoop
two inches broad. When first tried
the engine goes marvelously bad; it
made eight strokes per minute; but
upon Joseph&#8217;s endeavoring to mend
it, it stood still; and that, too,
though the piston was helped with
all the appliances of hat, papier mach&eacute;, grease, blacklead powder,
a bottle of oil to drain through the hat and lubricate the sides, and
an iron weight above all to prevent the piston leaving the paper
behind in its stroke&mdash;after some imperfections of the valves were
remedied, the engine makes 500 strokes with about two hundred
weight of coals.&#8221; In another month or two, with better condensation,
it &#8220;makes 2,000 strokes with one hundred weight of coals.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Emery and Carborundum Wheels.</h3>

<p>Emery, carborundum and alundum wheels are developed from
the grindstone of the distant past. That stone gives a straight-line
finish or edge to the surfaces submitted to
it; and as the work is shifted in front of the
stone these surfaces may take a curved or other
contour. But a grindstone, let it be as hard as
can be found, is not hard enough to take and keep any other than
a cylindrical form. Its successors of to-day, the carborundum
wheel especially, can be of varied shapes, and transfer these to
metal with celerity and economy.</p>

<p>Carborundum, a compound of silicon and carbon, is produced
at Niagara Falls, New York, by a process devised by Mr. E. G.
Acheson. In an electrical furnace are placed granulated coke,
sand, a little salt, and some sawdust to keep the mixture porous
and allow generated gases to escape freely. The crystals of
carborundum thus produced require seven horse-power hours
for each pound; in hardness they are excelled by the diamond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
only. United under severe hydraulic pressure by a vitrified
bond they are eight times as efficient as emery in abrasion. Carborundum
wheels are replacing
lathes as a means
of finishing axles, piston-rods
and rolls; their accuracy
is unsurpassed, while
they demand but one third
the time needed by a steel
tool.</p>

<h3>Form in Plastic Arts.</h3>

<p>At the very dawn of art
moist clay was molded into
useful plates and bowls.
This foreran not only all
that the potter has since
accomplished, but all that
has been achieved in the
foundry and the mint. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
making bricks, tiles, and terra cotta, the first task is to make the
clay plastic, then advantage is taken of its plasticity. In like
manner we heat a metal to fluidity, and then pour it into a mold
to make a fence rail, a stove plate, or a car
wheel. An electric bath refines upon this
process. Copper, let us say, dissolves in a
tank, and concurrently its particles are deposited on a mold from
which the metal can be readily stripped, avoiding the distortion
inevitable when heat has come into play.</p>

<p>Within the past ten years concrete has grown into much importance
as a building material, especially as reinforced with steel. It
is a great deal easier and cheaper to pour a wall into molds than
to lay courses of brick, or cut and dispose stone-work. Elsewhere
in this book a few pages are given to <a href="#Page_429">reinforced concrete</a>, and its
applications.</p>

<h3>Pressing and Stamping.</h3>

<p>Pressing, like molding, has of late years much extended its
range of forms. In germ it goes back to the distant day when
seals were impressed upon clay tablets, and
coins or medals were struck from hard matrices.
In glass manufacture the press has been
used for centuries. Cheap pressed tumblers and bowls have long
been accompanied by cheap metal pots and pans, plates and basins,
stamped by machinery. To-day much enlarged and improved,
such machinery, as a Bliss press, makes a kitchen sink from a
sheet of steel, forms gears and pinions from round bars of metal,
and executes the intricate curves of a mandolin in a plate of
aluminum. For a good while the spinning lathe gave us from thin
metallic sheets a variety of cups, saucers, dishes, parts of kettles,
lamps, and the like. To-day each of these articles is produced by
a single blow of a die, proving that metals are plastic in a degree
unsuspected in former days. Thus it comes about that the seams
necessary to the tinman and the coppersmith, with all their liability
to leaks and uncleanliness, have been largely dismissed and may
soon be wholly banished. Pressing is illustrated on <a href="#Page_184">pages 184 to
186</a> of this book.</p>

<h3>Old and New Means of Conferring Form.</h3>

<p>To-day we are rich in old and new facilities for the bestowal
of form. To confer shape by division we have an immense variety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of knives, scissors, saws, axes, hatchets and shears. These, together
with hammers, chisels and gouges enable us to disengage
from a mass not merely a simple rail, panel, or
table-top, but a carving or a statue. Surfaces
are smoothed with a rasp, a file, a plane; sand
is rubbed on abrasively, or falls from a height,
or is forcibly blown with a blast of steam or air. Emery either
spread on paper, or glued upon a wheel, grinds with an accuracy
and speed new to art; and all that emery can do is outdone by carborundum
and alundum, which slice away metal as if chalk, be its
hardness what it may. Perforation is accomplished with rotary
drills, or by a sandblast, or
on occasion by corrosive
acids&mdash;a final resource in
treating refractory stone.
Rolls of tremendous power
reduce iron and steel in
thickness, and, when suitably
shaped, confer form on railroad
rails, girders and the
like. Every tool and implement,
old or new, is now embodied
in machines of gigantic
force, or multiple effect, so that the skill of an earlier generation
is either not in demand at all or passes to tasks of a delicacy
never attempted before. It is by virtue of presses, enormous in
power, that to-day shapes are bestowed on metals in successful
rivalry with the ancient art of the founder himself. Indeed the
art of conferring form by pouring a liquid into molds is at this
hour largely exercised in work where heat plays no part whatever,&mdash;as
in the tasks of the builder in concrete, the labors of the
electrician as he employs a bath to separate a metal from its ore,
or to plate a surface with silver or gold.</p>

<h3>Use Creates Beauty.</h3>

<p>In strong contrast with the varied resources
of modern toil are the simple tools and implements
of prehistoric skill which, modified much
or little, are at this hour still indispensable to the mechanic, the
builder, the engineer. These simple aids early became admirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
in form so as to be all the more useful. Says Mr. George
Bourne<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The beauty of tools is not accidental but inherent and essential.
The contours of a ship&#8217;s sail bellying in the wind are not more inevitable,
nor more graceful, than the curves of an adze-head or of
a plowshare. Cast in iron or steel, the gracefulness of a plowshare
is less destructible than the metal, yet pliant, within the
limits of its type. It changes for different soils; it is widened out
or narrowed; it is deep-grooved or shallow; not because of caprice
at the foundry or to satisfy an artistic fad, but to meet the technical
demands of the expert plowman. The most familiar example
of beauty indicating subtle technique is supplied by the admired
shape of boats, which is so variable, says an old coastguardsman,
that the boat best adapted for one stretch of shore
may be dangerous if not entirely useless at another stretch ten
miles away. And as technique determines the design of a boat,
or of a wagon, or of a plowshare, so it controls absolutely the
fashioning of tools, and is responsible for any beauty or form they
possess. Of all tools, none, of course, is more exquisite than a
fiddle-bow. But the fiddle-bow never could have been perfected,
because there would have been no call for its tapering delicacy, its
calculated balance of lightness and strength, had not the violinist&#8217;s
technique reached such marvelous fineness of power. For it
is the accomplished artist who is fastidious as to his tools; the
bungling beginner can bungle with anything. The fiddle-bow,
however, affords only one example of a rule which is
equally well exemplified by many humbler tools. Quarryman&#8217;s
pick, coachman&#8217;s whip, cricket-bat, fishing-rod, trowel,
all have their intimate relation to the skill of those who use them;
and like animals and plants adapting themselves each to its
own place in the universal order, they attain to beauty by force
of being fit. That law of adaptation which shapes the wings
of a swallow and prescribes the poise and elegance of the
branches of trees, is the same that demands symmetry in the
corn-rick and convexity in the barrel; and that, exerting itself
with matchless precision through the trained senses of haymakers
and woodmen, gives the final curve to the handles of
their scythes and the shafts of their axes. Hence the beauty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
a tool is an unfailing sign that in the proper handling of it technique
is present.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<h3>Convenience in the Use of Machines.</h3>

<p>&#8220;A tool is an investment, the interest which it earns depending
on the amount of work it turns out in a given time. This depends
largely on its convenience of manipulation, involving
a study of levers, handles, wheels,
knobs and other auxiliary devices, their shape
and place with reference to the best adaptation
to the average human frame, the ease and extent of their motions,
and the rapidity with which these motions may be accomplished.
The position of the operator, his natural tendencies, the motions
he will go through, all have to be imagined in view of the attainment
of his maximum convenience. This study, in the absence
of any counterpart of the proposed machine, often forces a resort
to rough models, or in lieu of this, a full-size blackboard sketch,
extending to the floor, upon which the location of parts may be
tried for convenience.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Resources Rich or Meagre as Affecting Invention.</h3>

<p>In the National Museum, at Washington, the visitor as he inspects
examples of American aboriginal art is astonished at its
union of utility and beauty. Boat and paddle,
spear and hook, basket and vase, are as admirable
in form as useful in traveling, fishing,
or carrying corn or water. How far an aboriginal
designer may go largely turns upon what variety of resources
Nature offers him. No few score families on a lonely islet
of the Pacific can possibly rival the cloths and carvings displayed
by tribes ranging a Pennsylvania, or a California, abounding with
diverse minerals, plants and animals. When skill and invention
occupy so rich a land they flower into the highest creations of aboriginal
art. And yet it may be that the very fewness of a designer&#8217;s
resources but spurs him to all the more ingenuity. It
depends upon who the man is. As we look upon a collection of
Eskimo harpoons and knives, coats and kayaks, we marvel that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
all these should be produced with so much excellence and variety
from a scanty store of bones and teeth, sinews and hides, with but

<h3>Aboriginal Art.</h3>

<p class="chapstart">So multiplied are the resources of modern industry that desired
forms are created at will, almost without regard to the
material employed. It is not so in primitive art, to which for a
brief space we will now turn so that our survey of form, though
all too cursory, may be refreshed by a contrast
of old with new. Let us begin with a glance at
some of the aids with which man first provided
himself, taking the gifts of nature just as they were offered. In
large areas of the Southern States, and of Central America, the
gourd for ages has been a
common plant, and has long
served many Indian tribes as
a water pitcher. On sea-shores,
where the gourd did
not grow, conch-shells were
used instead, their users
breaking away the outer
spines and the inner whorls,
leaving within a space clean
and clear. Both gourds and
shells gave their forms to
the clay vessels which succeeded
them.</p>

<p class="caption">Pomo basket. National Museum, Washington.</p>
</div>

<p>In Zuni land, says Mr. F.
H. Cushing, the first vessels
for water were sections of
cane or tubes of wood. We
may infer that the wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
tubes were copied from the cane stems. What at first was passively
accepted as nature gave it, was afterward changed a little,
and then was step by step changed much, so that at length there
grew up processes of manufacture. There was, for example, in
California a wealth of osiers, reeds, and roots well suited for making
baskets; these at last were perfected as water-tight receptacles
neither brittle like a shell nor liable to a gourd&#8217;s swift decay. Beginning
probably in mere wattling, in the rude plaiting of mats
and roofs, the weaver came gradually upon finer and stronger
materials than at first, with equal pace rising to new delicacy of
finish and beauty of design. At the National Museum in Washington,
the Hudson collection of Indian baskets from California
includes the finest specimen in the world, a Pomo basket. Its
sixty stitches to the running inch were possible only through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>

</div>

<p>It is interesting to observe the limitation imposed upon a
primitive designer by the qualities of the leaf, shell, or cane in his
hands, the way in which these qualities point him to the forms in
which he may excel. Of this we have capital examples in the
basket-work of the North American aborigines as described by
Mr. Otis T. Mason, in the report of the Smithsonian Institution,
1883-84. He says: &#8220;Along the coast of British Columbia the
great cedar (<i>Thuja gigantea</i>) grows in the greatest abundance,
and its bast furnishes a textile material of the greatest value.
Here in the use of this pliable material the savages seem for the
first time to have thought of checker-weaving. Mats, wallets,
and rectangular baskets are produced by the plainest crossing of
alternate strands varying in width from a millimeter to an inch.
Ornamentation is effected both by introducing different-colored
strands and by varying the width of the warp or the woof threads.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is not astonishing that a material so easily worked
should have found its way so extensively in the industries of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
stock of Indians. Neither should we wonder that the checker
pattern in weaving should first appear on the west coast among
the only peoples possessing a material
adapted to this form of ornamentation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Referring to the water-bottles of the Pai
Utes, Mr. Mason says: &#8220;This style can be
made coarse or fine, according to the
material and size of the coil and outer
threads. If two twigs of uniform thickness
are carried around, the stitch will be hatchy
and open; but if one of the twigs is larger
than the other, or if yucca or other fibre
replace one of them and narrower sewing
material be used, the texture will be much finer.&#8221; Baskets and
rain-hats, as woven by Haidas and many other tribes, are waterproof
when wet, owing to the closeness of their texture.</p>

<h3>Idiom of Material.</h3>

<p>When reeds or somewhat rigid fibres are woven, they compel
a straightness of edge in patterns and designs. A wave has to be
suggested by stepped or broken lines, and so
we have a rectilinear meander or fret, in contrast
with its free-hand form as developed in
a woven fabric. Under the constraint of her material a squaw
as she weaves a design into a basket, must give squareness to a
contour which would be somewhat rounded were it executed in
delicate threads. This is clear in the human figures of the <a href="#Fig130">Pomo
basket</a> shown on page 109; and in those of a <a href="#Fig134">Yokut basket bowl</a>,

<p>Stone and brick-work, in their rectilinear shapes, impose a rigidity
in architectural design from which modern bricks, in their rich
variety of flat and curved surfaces, have wrought emancipation.
In the new residential streets of St. Louis, for example, the architecture
owes much of its freedom and beauty to the new shapes
in which brick is now manufactured. Even wider liberty than
now falls to the lot of the brick-maker has always been enjoyed
by the potter. In his hands clay lends itself to any desired imitation,
to any fresh design however fanciful; what is more it invites
those modifications of old forms in which art takes its chief
forward strides. All but infinite are the variations which Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
potters have played on the shapes of vases, jars, kettles,
and basins, each clearly true to its type, while at the same time
original in a pleasing way. How the Japanese artist in clay has
rejoiced in his freedom is exemplified in the collection of Japanese
pottery at the Museum of Fine Arts, in Boston. Says Mr.
Edward S. Morse, who brought this collection together: &#8220;Utensils
for every day life, terra cotta funeral urns, large terra cotta
bowls, weights for fishing nets, brush handles, and even clothes-hooks
are in Japan made of pottery. Where we use silver and
other metals, or glass, in making articles for daily use, the Japanese
use pottery.&#8221; He adds: &#8220;The prehistoric pottery of Japan
was modeled by hand, and to-day in various parts of the empire,
this ancient art is continued in its prehistoric form. There are
many potters in Japan who are still at work using only the hand
in making bowls, delicate tea-pots, and dishes of various kinds.
The pottery vessels offered at Shinto shrines are usually made
without the use of the wheel and are unglazed. The potter&#8217;s
wheel was brought to Japan from Korea. The first was probably
the kick-wheel used in Satsuma and other southern provinces.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Japanese employ not only clay but wood in methods that
richly repay study. Says Mr. Ralph Adams Cram<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;In one
respect Japanese architecture is unique: it is a style developed
from the exigencies of wooden construction, and here it stands
alone as the most perfect mode in wood the world has known.
As such it must be judged, and not from the narrow canons of
the West that presuppose masonry as the only building material. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Perhaps the greatest lesson one learns in Japan is that of
the beauty of natural wood, and the right method of treating it.
The universal custom of the West has been to look on wood as a
convenient medium for the obtaining of ornamental form through
carving and joinery, the quality of the material itself being seldom
considered. In Japan the reverse is the case. In domestic
work a Japanese builder shrinks from anything that would draw
attention from the beauty of his varied woods. He treats them
as we do precious marbles, and one is forced to confess that under
his hand wood is found to be quite as wonderful a material as
our expensive and hardly worked marbles. In Japan one comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
to the final conclusion that stains, paints, and varnish, so far as
interior work is concerned, are nothing short of artistic crimes.&#8221;<a

&#8220;Impressions of Japanese Architecture and the Allied Arts,&#8221; by Ralph
Adams Cram. New York, Baker &amp; Taylor Co., 1905.</p></div>

<p>In strong contrast with the art of Japan is that of Egypt; on
the banks of the Nile the first buildings were of limestone, succeeded
by huge structures reared from Syene granite, with no
little loss in delicacy of ornamentation. It was only when marble,
all but plastic under the chisel, was adopted by the Greek sculptor,
that the frieze of the Parthenon could spring into life.</p>

<p>Here William Morris should be heard. In &#8220;Hopes and Fears
for Art,&#8221; he says: &#8220;All material offers certain difficulties to be
overcome and certain facilities to be made the most of. Up to a
certain point you must be master of your material, but you must
never be so much the master as to turn it surly, so to say. You
must not make it your slave, or presently you will be its slave
also. You must master it so far as to make it express a meaning,
and to serve your aim at beauty. You may go beyond that necessary
point for your own pleasure and amusement, and still be in
the right way; but if you go on after that merely to make people
stare at your dexterity in dealing with a difficult thing, you have
forgotten art along with the rights of your material, and you will
make not a work of art, but a mere toy; you are no longer an
artist, but a juggler. The history of art gives us abundant examples
and warning in this matter. First clear, steady principle,
then playing with the danger, and lastly falling into the snare,
mark with the utmost distinctness the times of the health, the
decline, and the last sickness of art.&#8221; He illustrates this in detail
from the history of mosaic in architecture.</p>

<p>While the modern artist duly respects the idiom of his new
materials, their diversity and refinement, in granting him the utmost
freedom, enable him to attain a truth of execution unknown
before to-day. For writing on papyrus a brush had to be used;
on vellum or paper, a pen or pencil may also be employed, tracing
lines no wider than a hair. Our grandmothers were fond of sewing
on a perforated card a motto or a flower in silk thread; such
a sampler always had an unpleasant straightness in its outlines.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
When in weaving silk or linen there may be two hundred threads
to the running inch instead of ten, the designer can introduce
curves almost as flowing as if he
were a painter. So too in architecture:
the log hut was perforce
straight in its every line; stone and
brick made possible the arch; iron
and steel are bringing in a free
choice of the best lines, whether
straight or curved, all with a new
sprightliness, as witness the best of
our office-buildings in New York,
such as the Whitehall, Trinity, and
Empire Buildings.</p>

<h3>Old Forms Repeated in New Materials.</h3>

<p>Art in its early stages seldom displays any outright invention;
with all the force of habit the savage artist clings to old familiar
shapes, and it is interesting to remark how
dealing with a new material may lead or even
oblige him to modify a traditional form. The
Algonquins inhabit a country in which the birch
is common. They cut and fold its bark into vessels which, when
imitated in pottery, have an unusual rectangularity. In many
Indian tribes it was customary
to use as a water-holder
the paunch of a deer or a
buffalo; many ancient urns
of Central America have an
aperture at an upper extremity,
copied from the
paunch, in every case with a
simplification of outline. Winged troughs of wood were undoubtedly
in the mind of the man who made the <a href="#Fig138">earthen vessel</a>
illustrated on the next page, found in an ancient grave in Arkansas.
As usual the borrower put something of himself into his work,
reminding us that the law of evolution is descent with modification.
An <a href="#Fig139">earthen vessel</a>, illustrated on the next page, was
plainly copied from a shell vessel such as the specimen found not
far off, in Indiana. When the Clallam Indians, of the State of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Washington, began to weave baskets, they imitated the forms of
their rude wicker fish-traps. The like persistence was shown by
the Haida squaws when
taught by the missionaries to
make mats from rags; they
repeated their ancient twined
model, long employed for
mats and hats of vegetable
fibres. As in America, so
also in Europe; when the
makers of celts passed from
stone to copper or bronze,
they reproduced the old
forms, and only gradually
learned to economize metal,
so much stronger than stone,
and so much harder to get,
by narrowing and flattening their new weapons and tools.</p>

</div>

<p>Modern manufacture in its designs gives us a kindred persistence
of old forms in new
things. For electric illumination
we have bulbs which
recall the shape of a candle-blaze,
or surmount an old-fashioned
candlestick; a gas-burner,
popular for fifty years, repeats in milky porcelain the
whole length of a candle. Gas-grates, in uncounted thousands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
throughout our cities every winter, offer us flames which flicker
and leap over asbestos and clay molded into the semblance of maple
or charcoal. Nor is the engineer himself, for all his sternness of
discipline, quite free from prolonging the reign of the past, even at
unwarrantable cost. When steel was first used for steam boilers
there was a period of hesitation during which the metal was used
unduly thick, as if to maintain the long familiar massiveness of
iron structures. When automobiles were invented, they at first
closely resembled common carriages. To-day, designers have departed
from tradition, and provide us with horseless vehicles which
respond to their new needs in ways wholly untrammeled by inherited
ideas. In an automobile, driven by steam or gasoline,
there must be due disposition of fuel, of machinery, of cooling
apparatus, all so combined as to bring the center of gravity as
low as may be best, affording ready access to any part needing
lubrication, repair, or renewal; throughout there must be the
minimum of dead weight, of friction, and of liability to derangement;
all with means of easy, quick, and certain control. Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
should these requirements be deferred to repeating the model of
a carriage drawn by a horse? In Europe, to this hour, the railroad
carriages are an imitation of the old road-coaches, horse
carriages slightly modified. America, fortunately, from the first
has had cars directly adapted to railroad exigencies, with a thoroughfare
extending the whole length of a train, avoiding the
box-like compartments which may give the lunatic or the murderer
an opportunity to work his will.</p>

<p>Sometimes an inherited form taken to a new home proves to
be faulty there, and is discarded. When Normandy sent forth
its children to Canada, they built on the shores of the St. Lawrence
just such high-pitched roofs as had sheltered them in Caen
and Rouen. An example remains at Montreal in the roof of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Notre Dame de Bonsecours. But in Montreal and Quebec the
snowfall is much heavier than in Northern France, and the Norman
roofs at intervals from December to March were wont to let
loose their avalanches with an effect at times deadly. To-day,
therefore, in French Canada many of the roofs, especially in
towns and cities, are flat or nearly flat, while the best models
quite reverse the old design. In breadths somewhat concave they
catch the snow as in a basin, and allow it to melt slowly so as to
run down a pipe through the center of the building.</p>

<p>Under our eyes, day by day, iron and steel are taking the place
of stone and wood in architecture and engineering; yet the force
of habit leads us to continue in metal many troublesome details
which were imperative in the weak building materials of generations
past. It was as recently as the autumn of 1903 that the first
large American theater was opened having no columns to obstruct
views of its stage. The architects of the <a href="#Fig142">New Amsterdam
Theater</a>, New York, simply by availing themselves of the strength
of steel cantilevers have shown that henceforth all large auditoriums
may be free from obstructions to a view of the stage,
pulpit or platform. See facing page 118.</p>

<p>Modern architecture, in the judgment of an eminent critic, has
not yet fully responded to its new materials and methods. Says
Mr. Russell Sturgis, of New York, in &#8220;How to Judge Architecture&#8221;<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;Every
important change in building, in the past, has
been accomplished by a change in the method of design, so that
even in the times of avowed revival there was seen no attempt
to stick to the old way of designing while the new method of
construction was adopted; now in the nineteenth century, and in
what we have seen of the twentieth century, our great new systems
of building have flourished and developed themselves without
effect as yet upon our methods of design. We still put a
simulacrum of a stone wall with stone window casings and pediments
and cornices and great springing arches outside of thin,
light, scientifically combined, carefully calculated metal&mdash;the
appearance of a solid tower supported by a reality of slender
props and bars.&#8221;</p>

aspects.</p>

<h3>Cinders Big and Little.</h3>

<p>One frosty evening I sat with three young pupils in a room
warmed by a grate-fire. Shaking out some small live coals, I
bade the boys observe which of them turned
black soonest. They were quick to see that
the smallest did, but they were unable to tell
why, until I broke a large glowing coal into a score of fragments,
which almost at once turned black. Then one of them cried,
&#8220;Why, smashing that
coal gave it more surface!&#8221;
This young
scholar was studying
the elements of astronomy
that year, so
I had him give us
some account of how
the planets differ
from one another in
size, how the moon
compares with the
earth in volume, and
how vastly larger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
than any of its worlds is the sun. Explaining to him the fiery
origin of the solar system, I shall not soon forget his delight&mdash;in
which the others presently shared&mdash;when it burst upon him
that because the moon is much smaller than the earth it must be
much cooler; that indeed, it is like a small cinder compared with
a large one. It was easy to advance from this to understanding
why Jupiter, with eleven times the diameter of the earth, still
glows faintly in the sky by its own light, and then to comprehending
that the sun pours out its wealth of heat and light because the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
immensity of its bulk means a comparatively small surface to
radiate from.</p>

<div class="figc250" id="Fig145">
<img src="images/illo156.png" alt="" width="250" />
<p class="caption">Cube built of 27 cubes of 9
times more surface.</p>
</div>

<p>To make the law concerned in these examples definite and clear,
I took eight blocks, each an inch cube, and had the boys tell me
how much surface each had&mdash;six square inches. Building the
eight blocks into one cube, they then counted the square inches
of its surface&mdash;twenty-four: four times as many as those of each
separate cube. With twenty-seven blocks built into a cube, that
structure was found to have a surface of fifty-four square inches&mdash;nine
times that of each component block. As the blocks underwent
the building process, a portion of
their surfaces came into contact, and
thus hidden could not count in the outer
surfaces of the large cubes. The outer
surfaces of these large cubes I then
painted white; when each was separated
into its eight or twenty-seven
blocks, we saw in unpainted wood how
surfaces were increased by this
separation into the original small
cubes. Observation and comparison
brought the boys to the rule involved
in these simple experiments. They
wrote: Solids of the same form vary
in surface as the <i>square</i>, and in contents as the <i>cube</i>, of their like
dimensions.</p>

<p>This elementary law I traced that year in a variety of illustrations
presented in &#8220;A Class in Geometry,&#8221; published by A. S.
Barnes &amp; Co., New York. Our excursions, since extended, are
here given as an example of the knitting value of a pervasive rule
kept constantly in mind.</p>

<h3>Earth Sculpture.</h3>

<p>Our planet in diverse ways illustrates the law, just stated, of
surfaces and volumes. Forces of unresting activity quietly transform
the hills and plains, the sea coasts and
lake shores of the world, and so gradually that
in many cases detection proceeds only by noting
the changes wrought in a century. For the most part these forces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
break up large masses into fragments, or slowly wear away the
surfaces of rocks into dust. A lichen takes root on a granite
ledge, and in a few years reduces the rock to powder. Rain always
contains a little acid, so that in time flint itself is consumed,
for all its hardness. Water soaking through soils to form underground
streams has hollowed out vast caves, as notably in Virginia
and Kentucky. Limestones and sandstones are of open
texture, and take up much moisture into their pores; in cold
weather this freezes, and in expansion wedges off thin flakes of
stone. In the North one sees the ground strewn with such
splinters when the warm April sun has melted the snow from beside
a limestone fence. Watch the rills as they descend a hillside
during a rainstorm and just afterward. They are dark with mud,
and on steep declivities they carry down pebbles and bits of
broken stone, building up valleys at the expense of high ground.
Fed on a huge scale by such mud, the Mississippi River bears in
suspension to the Gulf of Mexico a little more than a pound of
solid matter in every cubic yard, a prime example of how the
waters of the globe gain upon the land. The Falls of Niagara
have retreated several miles from their original plunge; the carving
of their channel has been wrought much less by the rushing
waters than by their burden of abrading earth and sand. The
ceaseless churning of water at the foot of the Falls cuts back
into the rock, undermining its upper layers, so that ever and anon
they break off from the brink of the cataract, with the effect that
the stream steadily retires.</p>

<p>Throughout the ocean are strong currents to be constantly surveyed
and charted on the mariner&#8217;s behalf. These currents transport
fine mud, and organisms living and dead. Corals flourish
best where such currents fetch an abundant supply of food, just
as plants thrive best in rich, loose soil. Life in the sea just like
life on land is thus dependent on forces which divide large masses
into small, and distribute these small masses over wide areas,
chiefly by water carriage.</p>

<h3>Breaking Earth for Removal or Tilth.</h3>

<p>Inventors have taken a hint from nature as she carries a burden
of mud and pebbles in a rapid stream of water. A modern method
of deepening a water course is to reduce to fine silt the surface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of its bed, and then remove this silt with a powerful stream.
Water in swift eddies both lifts and bears away not only clay,
but stone and gravel when these are small enough. In placer-mining
streams of water much more powerful are directed against
hill-slopes of earth and stone, which disappear
a great deal faster than by means of spades
and shovels. One of our Northwestern railroads
runs for some miles along the base of a
steep ridge, from which at times heavy rains wash down masses
of earth, sand and gravel to the track. A powerful steam pump
forcing a stream through hose removes the obstructions from the
line with amazing rapidity. Work a good deal commoner and
vastly more important consists in taking a process begun by nature
and carrying it many steps further, so as to break up masses
of earth again and again. The plow, the harrow, the sharp-toothed
cultivator, divide and subdivide the soil of farm and garden
so as to offer rootlets new surfaces at which rain may be
drunk in with its nourishing food. When a garden patch is to
be fertilized by bones, these serve best when reduced to meal,
so as to be quickly and widely absorbed.</p>

<h3>Work of the Winds.</h3>

<p>In earth-sculpture one of the busiest agents is the wind,
especially as it seizes ocean waves and dashes them upon beach
and cliff, grinding large stones to pieces, and
reducing these at last to mere pebbles and sand.
On land the gales take hold of sand and dust
with effects even more telling: sand flung against the hardest
quartz or granite will bring it to powder at last. Sand dunes,
shifting under the stress of high winds, have spread desolation
around Provincetown, Massachusetts, and in many another region
once fertile enough. This process of nature immemorially old has
been copied in modern invention, by the sandblast devised by the
late General Tilghman of Philadelphia. In its simplest form,
sand from a hopper falls in a narrow stream upon window panes,
glassware and the like, to be roughened except where protected
by a paper pattern. Had sandstone in lumps, as large as playing
marbles, been dropped on the glass, there would have been harmful
fracture; as each particle of sand weighs too little in proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
to its striking surface to do more than detach a tiny chip,
we have a bombardment wholly useful.</p>

<h3>Dimensions in Ignition.</h3>

<p>Primitive man achieved an incomparable triumph when first he
kindled fire by swiftly twirling one dry stick upon another, dropping
the tiny sparks on finely divided tinder,
quick to catch fire because it presented much
surface to the air. Peat, a fuel common in
many parts of the world, easily dug from bogs and marshes, can
be readily dried if chopped into fragments and exposed to the
wind in open sheds. Charcoal easily produced from wood of any
kind, is often used to absorb harmful gases in boxes of preserved
meats and in household refrigerators. Its effectiveness is due to
its minute pores, presenting as they do a vast area of capillary
attraction. Charcoal, of course, burns faster when powdered
than when unbroken; and gunpowder, into which charcoal largely
enters, is molded into cakes either big, if it is to burn somewhat
slowly, or is pressed into fine grains, when an explosion all but
instantaneous is desired.</p>

<h3>Dust Common and Uncommon.</h3>

<p>Common dust surrounds us always, entering the tiniest chink
of wall and ceiling to show its path by a defacing mark. In dry
seasons it abounds to a distressing degree, and
accumulates rapidly at considerable heights
from the ground. Observe a roof of the kind
that slopes gradually toward the street, with a
trough running along the cornice to carry off the rain or melted
snow. When such a gutter is undisturbed for a few months it
is clogged with mud due to the dust which has been lifted by
winds to the roof, and swept by successive showers into the
gutter. Dust particles, because they have so much surface for
their mass, are readily caught up and borne to heights far exceeding
those of the highest roofs. The terrific explosion of the
volcano at Krakatoa, in the Sunda Strait of Java in 1883, shot
more than four cubic miles of dust into the upper levels of the
atmosphere, encircling the globe with particles which fell so
slowly as for months to color the sunsets of New York and
Canada, ten thousand miles away.</p>

<h3>Inflammable Dust.</h3>

<p>Wheat like other grain is combustible, hence as food it sustains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
bodily warmth. Under stress of necessity wheat, corn, and barley
have been burned as fuel when coal and wood have been lacking.
In the process of flour-making wheat is ground to a powder so
fine that when its particles are diffused through the air of a mill,
there is a liability to explosion because the inflammable
dust comes so near to contact with
the atmospheric oxygen that at any moment
they may unite. At Minneapolis, frightful disasters were brought
about in this way until specially devised machines removed the
dust. In coal mines, too, coal may fill the air with a dust so fine
that explosions take place, with serious loss of life. In Austria it
has been found that the fineness of the dust has more to do with
the violence of such explosions than has the chemical composition
of the particles.</p>

<p>In mining, let us observe, the whole round of work consists in
separations which bring masses from bigness to smallness, again
and again. First of all the solid walls and floors are broken up
by pick, or drill, or powder, or all together. Iron ores as hoisted
to the surface of the earth are taken to breakers which crush them
into pieces suitable for the blast furnace. When the ores carry
gold, copper, lead, or tin, this crushing is followed by stamping
to facilitate the final process by which metal is separated from
worthless rock.</p>

<h3>Dimensions in Woven Fabrics.</h3>

<p>Spinning and weaving, remote as they are from mining, are
equally subject to the law of surfaces and volumes. It is in furthering
adhesion by giving their thread a multiplied
surface that the spinner and weaver
manufacture cloth at once strong and durable.
The best linens and silks are spun in exceedingly
fine threads; canvases and tweeds have threads comparatively
coarse. From the cut edge of a piece of fine silk fabric it
is hard to pull out a lengthwise thread; the task is easy with sailcloth.</p>

<h3>The Dimensions of Models.</h3>

<p>From observation let us turn to experiment as we further consider
the law of size. Inventors, especially young inventors, are
apt to underrate the difficulty of supplying an
old want in a new and successful way. In their
enthusiasm they may lose sight of principles
which oppose their designs, as for instance, the rules which govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the plain facts of dimensions. Mr. James B. Eads, in planning
his great bridge at St. Louis, chose three spans instead of one
span. Why? For the simple reason that if built in one span
the weight of the bridge would have been twenty-seven times
that of a span one-third as long, while only nine times as strong,
assuming that both structures had the same form. Two pieces of
rubber will clearly exhibit the contrast in question. One piece
is three feet long, one inch wide, one inch thick; the other piece
is one foot long, and measures in width and thickness one-third
of an inch. Placing each on supports at its ends we see how
much more the longer strip sags than the shorter. The longer
has twenty-seven times the mass of the other, but only nine times
its strength. Many an inventor has ignored this elementary fact
and built a model of a bridge, or roof, which has seemed excellent
in the dimensions of a model, only to prove weak and
worthless when executed in full working size.</p>

<div class="figc550" id="Fig146">
<img src="images/illo161.png" alt="" width="550" height="138" />
<p class="caption">The upper strip of rubber is thrice as long, wide and deep as the
lower, which sags less.</p>
</div>

<h3>Why Big Ships are Best.</h3>

<p>We have glanced at a few cases of invention where it has been
remembered that the larger a mass of given shape the less its
surface as compared with its bulk. Let us note
how this rule enters into the tasks of the shipbuilder.
We take a narrow vial of clear glass,
nearly fill it with white oil or glycerine, cork
it, and shake it smartly. Holding the vial upright we observe
that the largest bubbles of imprisoned air come first to the top
of the liquid, because in comparison with bulk they have least
surface to be resisted as they rise. For a parallel case we visit
the docks of New York, and note a wide diversity of steamers.
Here is the &#8220;Baltic,&#8221; of the White Star Line, with a length of
726 feet, and a displacement of 28,000 tons. Less than a mile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
away is a small steamer trading to Nova Scotia, having a length
of but 260 feet, and a displacement of only 1,000 tons or so. We
recognize at once why the quickest ships are always among the
biggest. It is simply the case of bubbles small
and great over again; the biggest vessels in proportion
to size have least surface whereat to resist
air and sea, so that they can run fastest between
port and port. As with ships, so with their
engines; economy rests with bigness; the largest
engines have proportionately least surface at which
to lose heat by radiation or by contact, or for resistance
by friction as they move. Indeed in designing
ocean steamers of the greyhound type it
is imperative that the utmost possible dimensions
be adopted. The &#8220;Mauretania&#8221; and the &#8220;Lusitania&#8221;
just built for the Cunard Company, to be
driven by steam turbines at 25 knots an hour, will
each demand 70,000 horse-power. They are 790
feet in length over all, 88 feet in beam, 60<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> feet
in depth, with a displacement of 45,000 tons. Mr.
William F. Durand, in his work on the resistance
and propulsion of ships, considers three vessels
less huge and swift than these Cunarders and
able to cross the Atlantic in say seven days. The
5,000-ton ship could barely make the trip with no
cargo at all, a 16,000-ton ship would be able to
carry 3,000 tons of freight, while a 20,000-ton
ship could carry 4,200 tons of cargo. Burdens of
hull, machinery, and coal do not increase as rapidly as gross
tonnage when the dimensions of a ship are enlarged.</p>

<div class="figc200" id="Fig147">

<p class="caption">Air bubbles rising
in oil.</p>
</div>

<h3>Bigness Needs Strong Materials.</h3>

<p>Now we begin to realize how great is the boon of cheap steel,
much stronger than iron, of which ships and engines may be built
bigger than at any earlier period. Steel of
great strength has made feasible, too, the Eiffel
Tower in Paris, nearly a thousand feet tall, the
office-buildings of New York thirty stories in height, and steel
will soon cross the St. Lawrence near Quebec with a single span
of 1,800 feet. In 1904, at Schenectady, N. Y., the New York<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad Company began comparisons
between an <a href="#Fig284">electric locomotive</a> of 201,000 pounds, shown opposite
page 476, and a steam locomotive so huge that with its tender it
weighed no less than 342,000 pounds. Steel, as the material of
engines and tools of all sorts enables us to build in dimensions
bolder than ever before; or, if old dimensions are not surpassed,
we are free to employ velocities quite out of the question with
iron.</p>

<p>It is a long time since adventurers first entrusted themselves to
floating logs, afterward tied together as rafts, and slowly improved
until they became boats moved by paddles or oars. Thus
far little else than failure has attended the inventors who have
sought to navigate the air as easily as river, lake or sea. A stride
toward success was however distinctly taken when the strongest
known alloys, those of steel and nickel, gave the aeronaut a
stronger boiler, pound for pound, than he ever had before, with
wings lighter in proportion to their power than those of earlier
experiments. Let the burden of his apparatus be further reduced,
and by one-half; then we may expect him to reign in the
air as securely as the sea-gull. The original resource of the aeronaut,
his balloon, suffers from a permanent disability. Air has
but <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>770</sub> the specific gravity of water, so that a balloon must be
enormous to have any carrying capacity worth while. And what
would become of a balloon, its rudder and ropes, if caught in a
hurricane of eighty miles an hour?</p>

<h3>A Store Continues the Lesson.</h3>

<p>Let the aeronaut continue his wistful and envious gaze at the
birds in the sky while we turn our attention to mother earth, there
to note how every day trade surrounds us with
further illustrations of the law of size, of the
gains which may attend bigness. We enter a
department store, displaying a varied stock of
foods, clothing, shoes, furniture, and so on. As we cast our eyes
about its counters, shelves, and floor we see cans of vegetables,
fruit, and fish; jars of olives and vinegar; boxes of rice, soap and
crackers; paper sacks of flour and meal. Outside the door are
piled kegs, barrels, and packing cases. Plainly the cost of paper,
glass, tin, and lumber for packages must levy a large tax on retailing.
Once more is recalled our old lesson with the inch-cubes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the bigger a jar, box, or sack, the less material it needs in
proportion to its capacity. Wholesale packers of merchandise
save money as they form packages of the largest size. The contents
of each box, crate, and sack tell the familiar story once
again. The coffee is ground from the bean that it may be readily
infused in the coffee-pot; wheat is reduced to flour, oats to fine
meal, that they may be quickly cooked; sugar is crushed that it
may rapidly dissolve in the tea cup. This very task began long
ago with the mastication of food by the teeth, diminishing the size
of morsels while moistening them for digestion before they
reached the stomach.</p>

<h3>Summer Holiday Notes.</h3>

<p>During a visit to the country one summer, we observed new
examples of our familiar rule. When we compared the dimensions
of a small sectional cabin with those of
a large house, we saw the principal reason why
the cabin was hard to keep cool in July, and
hard to keep warm in December. We noticed tasks which depended
upon giving wood, cloth or other material as much surface
as possible, whether new forms were like old ones or not. A
neighboring sawmill was busy cutting up logs into thin boards;
these were piled in open tiers, so that the drying winds might
speedily finish their work. In the same way we noted a laundress
spreading out by itself each table-cloth and apron fully to catch
the wind, instead of leaving the linen as a solid heap in her
basket, where only the edges would be dried. When the farm-hands
went haymaking they followed the same rule; they tedded
out their gavels to give them the utmost supply of sun and air;
when all was as dry as a bone they reared a haycock of compact
form so as to expose the least possible surface to rain and snow.</p>

<h3>Dimensions Molecular.</h3>

<p>So much for things to be observed in a country ramble, in a city
store, or at the docks of a busy port. Apart from all such things
is a world unseen, standing beneath the visible
world, and equally worthy of study. Here
knowledge is based upon inferences, upon what
lawyers call circumstantial evidence. The chemist by means
purely indirect studies the molecule and the atom, objects that far
elude his microscope. A molecule is a part of a compound so
small that it cannot be divided without becoming something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
simpler. Thus a sugar molecule is made up of carbon, hydrogen,
and oxygen atoms; were these disjoined, the sugar, as such,
would cease to be, just as a brick wall no longer exists when its
bricks and their several slices of mortar are parted from one another
as separate units. Small as molecules are they have not
escaped the measuring rod of the physicist. Some years ago Lord
Kelvin experimentally arrived at the estimate that the average
molecule has a diameter of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>760,000,000</sub> inch. Such molecules
when compared with masses of like form, and of a diameter of
one inch; have 760,000,000 times as much surface. In the transmission
of motion, with adhesion in play, surfaces count for much,
as when a wheel in motion is brought into contact with a wheel at
rest. Here may be an explanation of why electricity is conducted
through a wire with a velocity far exceeding any speed we can
mechanically impress upon the metal, because the molecules concerned
have incomparably more surface than the wire as a mass.</p>

<h3>Reservoirs of Energy.</h3>

<p>By virtue, also, of its minuteness the molecule as a reservoir of
energy can far excel a mass of visible dimensions. Let us compare
two rotating spheres, one of them of seven
times the radius of the other. We spin both at
the same peripheral rate, and gradually increase
this speed: which will be the first to break apart under centrifugal
strain? The larger, and why? Because the cohesion of a sphere
is in proportion to the area of its great circle, which varies as the
square of its diameter, while centrifugal strain under swift rotation
varies as the cube of that diameter, or as the volume of the
sphere. From this it follows that we may safely spin our small
sphere with a circumferential velocity seven times that given the
large sphere; therefore as containers of energy small spheres are
more effective than large, and this inversely as their diameters.
Spheres, or bodies of any other form, if reduced in dimensions to
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>760,000,000</sub>th, would as reservoirs of energy gain 760,000,000-fold.
Thus we open a door of explanation regarding the stupendous
contrast between chemical energy and mechanical work.
Chemical processes are exerted by molecules and atoms, mechanical
work takes place among masses comparatively enormous in
bulk. It may require a hundred blows from a ponderous steam
hammer to raise the temperature of an iron bar ten degrees; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
bar melts in ten seconds when plunged into a flame produced by a
few ounces of hydrogen and oxygen gases.</p>

<p>Recent experiments by Professor Joseph J. Thomson point to
the probability that the atom of the chemist while a unit, is in part
built of electrons each but one-thousandth part the size of a
hydrogen atom. An electron, by virtue of its infinitesimal minuteness,
becomes able to hold proportionately much more energy than
is possible to an atom moving as a whole. This brings us to some
comprehension of the astonishing powers of radium, an element
which maintains itself at a temperature 3&deg; to 5&deg; Centigrade higher
than that of its surroundings, probably through the collision within
each atom of its component parts.</p>

<h3>Repulsion by Sound and Light.</h3>

<p>Water-waves as they strike a shore or the sides of a basin exert
a thrust, or a repelling action, which may easily be observed.
That sound-waves act in similar fashion is
proved by a little sound-mill devised in 1883 by
Professor V. Dvorak, of the University of
Agram in Austria. It consists of four vanes,
each a small card slightly curved, mounted on a spindle. In a
sounding-box nearby is a tuning-fork which may be struck through
its stem F. A Helmholtz resonator has its wide opening turned
toward this box, its narrow opening toward the mill. A stroke on
the tuning-fork emits vibrations which send tiny jets of air against
the sails of the mill, which accordingly rotate at a pace proportionate
to the loudness of the sound.</p>

<p class="caption">A beam of light deflects dust.</p>
</div>

<p>Professor Ernest F. Nichols of Columbia University, New
York, and Professor Gordon F. Hull of Dartmouth College, in
the Journal of Astrophysics, Chicago, June, 1903, describe their
apparatus for measuring the radiation pressure of light, a phenomenon
analogous to that studied by Professor Dvorak in the
field of sound. In the same number of that Journal they detail an
experiment to show light exerting a driving action on very tenuous
particles. They burned a puff ball
of lycoperdon to charcoal spherules
of about one-sixth the specific gravity
of water. These spherules, with
some fine emery sand, they placed in
a glass tube shaped like an hour-glass;
this tube was then exhausted
of its gases until a mere fraction remained
which could not be removed.
With the sand and charcoal in its
upper half the tube was held upright,
while a beam of light twenty to forty
times as strong as sunshine was
thrown on the tube just below its
neck. By tapping the glass a stream
of sand and charcoal descended; the
sand fell through the beam without
deflection; the charcoal particles were
driven away from the stream as they
fell through the light. Part of this
effect was due to the slight remnant
of gas left in the tube which, warmed by the light, produced a
motion resembling that of a Crookes&#8217; radiometer; the remainder
of the effect was caused by the drive or repulsion of the luminous
beam. It is argued that this repulsion by light is probably one of
the causes why the sun seems to drive away the tail of a comet,
whose particles being extremely minute have much surface and
little bulk, so that they are more repelled by the light of the sun
than they are attracted by his mass. To approach cometary conditions
in an experiment it would be necessary to intensify sunlight
no less than 1,600-fold, because on the surface of the earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
its own gravitation is 1,600 times greater than that which is there
exerted by the sun.</p>

<h3>A Law as a Binding Thread.</h3>

<p>The law that a given shape when enlarged increases much more
rapidly in volume than in surface has, in our brief survey, bound
together a wide diversity of facts in astronomy,
geology, geography, navigation, engineering,
mechanics, physics, and chemistry. A good
many times I have brought it before young
folks as a means of linking together everyday observations and
principles of sweeping comprehensiveness. Boys and girls are
apt to think that there is a formidable barrier between science and
common knowledge. No such barrier exists. The sun, his
planets and their moons; the forces which carve mountains and
valleys; the arts of shipbuilders, of designers of bridges, office-buildings,
and lighthouses; the plans of the inventors of machinery;
the rules discovered by investigators who pass from appearances
to the underlying reality of molecule and atom, are all
within the sway of the elementary law we have been studying.
There is a gain in thus pursuing a connecting thread of classification,
conferring order as it does on what might else be an assemblage
of things collected at random. A law such as that of size
links into unity, and fastens in the memory a vast array of observations
and experiments which otherwise would have no associating
tie, no common illumination.</p>

<p class="chapstart">Materials are valued for their properties as well as their
forms. We now pass to a rapid survey of properties as
observed in gifts of nature, as modified by art, as turned to account
in many ingenious ways, as studied by the investigators who
would fain know in what particulars of ultimate form, size and
motion, properties may really consist.</p>

<p>We go to market with a few different coins: one of them is
worth a hundred times as much as another of about the same size,
because gold is more beautiful than nickel, does not tarnish, may
be hammered into leaves of extreme thinness, or unites with
copper as an alloy which withstands abrasion for years after it
leaves the mint. When we build a house we wish strength in its
foundation and walls, so we pay a higher price for granite than
for limestone; and choose for joists, floors and rafters well
seasoned wood in preference to newly sawn lumber liable to
warp and crack with heat in summer, with cold in winter. So
with raiment: silk is preferred to cotton or wool because handsomer,
stronger, more lasting. But food comes before shelter,
raiment or any other need of mankind, and qualities of nourishment
and palatability mark off nuts, fruits, grain and roots as
suitable for food. In this regard all living creatures exercise
discrimination under penalty of death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<h3>Food.</h3>

<p>A score of sparrows are flitting about a door-yard; strew
a handful of crumbs on the gravel before them; at once the
birds begin picking up the bread, leaving the
gravel alone. They know crumbs, good to
eat, from stone, not good to eat. The earliest
races of men, immeasurably higher than birds in the scale of
life, have eaten every herb, root, grass, and fruit they could find.
Experiment here was as wide as the world, and bold enough in
all conscience. In many cases new and delicious foods, thoroughly
wholesome, were discovered. At other times, as when
the juice of the poppy was swallowed, sleep was induced, with
a hint for the escape from pain in artificial slumber. In less
happy cases the new food was poisonous; yet even this quality
was pressed into service. In Mendocino County, California, to
this day, the Indians throw soap root and turkey mullein, both
deadly, into the streams; the fish thus killed are eaten without
harm. These same Indians make acorns and buckeye horse
chestnuts into porridge and bread, pounding the seeds into a
fine flour and washing out its astringent part with water. These
and other aborigines use for food and industry many plants
neglected by the white man, taking at times guidance from the
lower animals. One of the early explorers of South Africa, Le
Vaillant, says that the Hottentots and Bushmen would eat nothing
that the baboons had left alone. Following their example
he would submit to a tame baboon new plants for acceptance or
rejection as food.</p>

<h3>Weapons and Tools.</h3>

<p>As with food so with other resources almost as vital. Long
ago the savage learned that hickory makes good bows and
arrows, that as a club it forms a stout and
lasting weapon. He discovered, too, that in
these qualities soft woods are inferior and
the sumach altogether wanting. Thus, too, with the whole
round of stones from which as a warrior or a craftsman he
fashioned knives, chisels, arrowheads, axes; it was important
that only tough and durable kinds should be employed. No
lump of dry clay ever yet served as a hammer or an adze; happy
were the tribes, such as those of ancient Britain, who had at hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
goodly beds of flint from which a few well directed blows could
furnish forth a whole armory of tools and weapons.</p>

<h3>Properties Modified.</h3>

<p>In the eating of foods simply as found, in the use of materials
for clothing or building just as proffered by the hand of nature,
much was learned as to their qualities; some
were found good, others indifferent, still others
bad. Then followed the art of modifying these
qualities, so as to bring, let us say, a fibre or a thong from
stiffness to pliability and so make it useful instead of almost
worthless. The progress of man from downright savagery may
be fairly reckoned by his advances in the power to change the
qualities of foods, raiment, materials for shelter, tools, and
weapons. These arts of modification go back very far. At
first they may have consisted simply in taking advantage of
the effects of time. In the very childhood of mankind it must
have been noticed that fruit harsh and sour became mellow with
keeping, just as now we know that a Baldwin apple harvested
in October will be all the better for cellarage until Christmas,
the ripening process continuing long after the apple has left
its bough. Grains and seeds when newly gathered are usually
soft and, at times, somewhat damp; exposed to the sun and dry
air for a few days they become hard and remain sound for
months or even years of careful storage. In warm weather
among many Indian tribes such food was almost the only kind
that remained eatable; all else went to swift decay, except in
parched districts such as those of Arizona, so that roots, fruits,
the flesh of birds, beasts, and fish had to be consumed speedily,
a fact that goes far to account for the gluttony of the red man.
His stomach was at first his sole warehouse; that filled, any
surplus viands went to waste. In frosty weather this havoc
ceased; as long as cold lasted there was no loss in his larder.
A few communities, as at Luray, Virginia, or at Mammoth Cave,
Kentucky, in their huge caverns had storehouses which would
preserve food all the months of the twelve. In New Mexico
and other arid regions the air is so dry that meat does not fall
into decay. How it was discovered that smoke had equal virtue
we know not. Probably the fact came out in observing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
accidental exposure of a haunch of venison as the reek from a
camp-fire sank into its fibres. Salt, too, was early ascertained
to have great value in preserving food. Suppose a side of buffalo,
or horse, to have fallen accidentally into brine in a pool or kettle,
and stayed there long enough for saturation, its keeping sweet
afterward would give a hint seizable by an intelligent housewife.
Preservation by burial in silos began in times far remote, and
was fully described by Pliny in the first century of the Christian
era.</p>

<h3>Properties in Clothing.</h3>

<p>The skin just taken from a sheep, the hide when removed from
an ox, are both as flexible as in life. But they soon stiffen so
as to be uncomfortable when worn as garments.
Wetting the pelt is but a transient
resource; satisfactory, because lasting, is the
effect of rubbing grease, fat, or oil into the texture of the hide.
Peary in Greenland found that pelts in small pieces, and bird-skins,
were softened by the Eskimo women chewing them for
hours together.</p>

<p>Wetting was as notable an aid to handicraft of old as today.
Boughs, roots, withes, osiers, or the stems of fibrous plants, when
thoroughly saturated with water became so soft as to be easily
worked, yielding strands, as in the case of hemp, separated from
worthless pulp. Hence the basketmaker, the wattler, the builder,
the potter, the weaver of rude nets and traps, long ago learned
to wet their materials to make them plastic. Take now the
reverse process of drying, which toughens wood, and the sinews
used as primitive thread. Leaves when dried become hard and
brittle of texture, hence the necessity that when woven and interlaced
as roofs the work shall promptly follow upon gathering
the material. In plaiting coarse mats and sails may have begun
the textile art which to-day gives us the linens of Belfast, the
silks of Lyons and Milan.</p>

<h3>Cotton Strengthened and Beautified.</h3>

<p>A good and serviceable imitation of silk is due to a simple
and ingenious treatment of cotton. In 1845 John Mercer, a
Lancashire calico printer, one day filtered a
solution of caustic soda through a piece of
cotton cloth. He noticed that the cloth, as it
dried, was strangely altered; it had shrunk
considerably both in length and breadth, had become stronger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
with an increased attraction for dyes. This was the beginning of
the mercerization which to-day produces cotton fabrics almost as
strong and handsome as if silk. The cloth, preferably woven of
long Sea Island staple, is immersed in a solution of caustic soda,
and afterward washed in dilute sulphuric acid and in pure water.
As it enters the caustic bath the cotton is pure cellulose, as it
leaves the bath the fabric is hydrated cellulose, with new and
valuable properties. The structural change in the fibre is decided.
The original filament of cotton is a flattened tube, the sides of
which are close together, leaving a central cavity which is enlarged
at each edge of the surrounding tube. It is opaque and
the surface is not smooth. The fibre has also a slight twist.
The tube after treatment becomes rounded into cylindrical form;
its cavity is lessened and the walls of its tube thicken; the surface
becomes smooth and each fibre assumes a spiral form.
Effects like these of mercerization are produced in paper as well
as in cotton cloth, yielding vegetable parchment, a familiar
covering for preserve jars and the like.</p>

<h3>Properties in Building Materials.</h3>

<p>Some sandstones, such as are common in Ohio and Indiana,
soft when hewn in the quarry, soon harden on exposure to
wind and weather; materials of this kind in
early times afforded shelter more lasting than
tents of boughs or hides. But the building
art was to know a gift vastly more important
when an artificial mud was blended of clay and water, with a
steady improvement both in the strength and durability of the
product. It was a golden day in the history of man when first
a clayey paste was patted into a pot, a bowl, a kettle: then was
laid the foundation of all that the potter, the brick maker, the
tile molder have since accomplished. Another remarkable discovery,
needing prolonged and faithful experiment, was reached
when pottery was found to keep its form better when broken
potsherds and bits of flint were mingled with its clay. A discovery
of equal moment was that of mortar, probably approached
in the daubing of mud or clay into chinks of stones, with the
admixture first of one substance and then another until the
right one was found, and the binder and the bound became of
one and the same hardness. The Romans, a deliberate race, took
two years in making a batch of mortar; that bond to-day protrudes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
from their walls as more resistant to the tooth of time
than stone itself.</p>

<h3>Flame and Electricity as Modifiers.</h3>

<p>But if water did much to modify properties, flame did infinitely
more. A block of blue limestone thrust into a fire was
burned to whiteness, and became lime, which,
mixed with water, proved a biting compound
of slippery feel,&mdash;an alkali indeed. This same
wonderful flame caused water wholly to disappear
from a heated kettle; or could dissipate almost the whole
of an ignited brand or lump of fat. By cooking a food, it gave
a new relish to the poorest dish, banished from such a root as
tapioca its poison, and when a yam was baked it remained eatable
for a twelvemonth. Fire enabled man to melt metals as if they
were wax, to soften iron or copper which a deftly swung hammer
shaped as he willed. Here, too, opened the whole world of
chemistry, one of its first gifts the power to take an ore worthless
when unchanged, and gain from it a battle-axe, a knife, an arrowhead.
Even in this day of electricity it is fire which the engineer
must evoke to create acids, alkalis, sugars, alcohols, from
substances as different from these as iron is from iron ore.</p>

<p>Electricity as a modifier of properties in turn throws flame
into eclipse. Take an example: a strip of ferro-nickel is fast
dissolving in an alkaline bath; attach one end of the metal to
the negative pole of a battery or a dynamo, the other end to
the positive pole; at once solution ceases and the metal begins
to pick out kindred particles from the bath, adding them to itself.
Electricity has completely reversed the wasting process; what
was eaten away is now growing, what was a compound is now
shaken into its elements, one of which rapidly increases in mass.
Nothing in the empire of heat is as striking as this process&mdash;familiar
in renewing the energy of a storage battery. Many a
union or a parting impossible to fire is wrought instantly by the
electric wave.</p>

<h3>The Bamboo Rich in Utilities.</h3>

<p>When Mr. Edison devised his electric lamp, his first successful
filaments were fibres of bamboo; they glowed more brilliantly
than anything else he could find, they were tenacious enough to
withstand intense heat for weeks together. A single gift of
nature, such as the bamboo, may be so many-sided that its applications<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
greatly enrich human life. A task of interest would be
to trace the vast indebtedness of modern science and art to carbon,
iron, or silver, in their various forms. But the bamboo is
cheaper and more abundant than any of these,
so that it will be worth while to glance at the
many wants it has satisfied, at the creations it
has suggested to ingenuity. In Ceylon, India,
China, Japan, the Malay archipelago, it is the chief item of
natural wealth, the main resource for the principal arts of life.
First of all it provides food. More than one case is recorded
where its abundant seeds have staved off the horrors of famine;
these seeds, too, are commonly fermented to produce a drink
resembling beer. Many species of bamboo have shoots which
when young and tender are a palatable and nourishing food.
As a building material it is strong, durable and easily divided.
Its sizes are various enough to provide a fishing-rod for a boy,
or a column for a palace.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the Chinaman, as to the Japanese,&#8221; says Mr. Freeman-Mitford,
in &#8220;The Bamboo Garden,&#8221; &#8220;the bamboo is of supreme
value; indeed it may be said that there is not a necessity, a
luxury, or a pleasure of his daily life to which it does not
minister. It furnishes the framework of his house and thatches
the roof over his head, while it supplies paper for his windows,
awnings for his sheds, and blinds for his verandah. His beds,
tables, chairs, cupboards, his thousand and one small articles
of furniture are made of it. Shavings and shreds of bamboo
stuff his pillows and mattresses. The retail dealer&#8217;s measure,
the carpenter&#8217;s rule, the farmer&#8217;s waterwheel and irrigating pipes,
cages for birds, crickets, and other pets, vessels of all kinds,
from the richly lacquered flower-stands of the well-to-do gentleman
down to the humblest utensils of the very poor, all come
from the same source. The boatman&#8217;s raft, and the pole with
which he punts it along; his ropes, his mat sails, and the ribs
to which they are fastened; the palanquin in which the stately
mandarin is borne to his office, the bride to her wedding, the
coffin to the grave; the cruel instruments of the executioner, the
beauty&#8217;s fan and parasol, the soldier&#8217;s spear, quiver, and arrows,
the scribe&#8217;s pen, the student&#8217;s book, the artist&#8217;s brush and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
favorite study for his sketch; the musician&#8217;s flute, the mouth-organ,
plectrum, and a dozen various instruments of strange
shapes and still stranger sounds&mdash;in the making of all these the
bamboo is a first necessity. Plaiting and wickerwork of all kinds,
from the coarsest baskets and matting down to the delicate filigree
which encases porcelain, are all of bamboo fibre. The same
material made into great hats like inverted baskets protects the
coolie from the sun, while the laborers in the rice fields go about
looking like animated haycocks in waterproof coats made of the
dried leaves of the bamboo sewn together.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Materials for Basketry.</h3>

<p>In North America the Indians have had no such resource as
the bamboo, but with tireless sagacity they have laid under contribution
either for food or for the arts every
gift of the soil. In seeking materials for basketry,
for example, they have surveyed the
length and breadth of the continent, testing
in every plant the qualities of root, stem, bark, leaf, fruit, seed
and gum, so far as these promised the fibres or the dyes for a
basket, a wallet, a carrier. With all the instinct of scientific
research they have sought materials strong, pliant, lasting and
easily divided lengthwise for refined fabrics. In his work on
&#8220;Indian Basketry&#8221; Mr. Otis T. Mason has a picture of a bam-shi-bu
coiled basket, having a foundation of three shoots of
Hind&#8217;s willow, sewn in the lighter portions with carefully prepared
roots of kahum, a sedge; while its ornamental designs are
executed in roots of a bulrush, the tsuwish. Often a basket, as
in this case, is built of materials found miles apart, each requiring
patient and skilful treatment at the artist&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>A few trees, the cedar in particular, lend themselves to the
needs of the basketmaker with a generous array of resources.
Mats of large size made from its inner bark are common among
the Indians of the Northern Pacific Coast. From the roots of
the same tree hats are woven as well as vessels so close in texture
as to be watertight. When the roots are boiled so as to be
readily torn into fibres, these are formed into thread, either woven
with whale-sinews or with kelp-thread as warp. Among the
handsomest of all Indian <a href="#Fig130">baskets</a> are those of the Pomo tribe,
one of which is shown on page 109. The splints for their creamy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
groundwork are made from the rootstock of the <i>Carex barbarae</i>,
which are dug from the earth with clam shells and sticks, a
woman securing fifteen to twenty strands in a day. These she
places in water over night to keep them flexible, and to soften
the scaly bark which is afterward removed. To make a basket
watertight the Indians of Oregon weave the inner bark of their
maple with the utmost closeness. In other regions a simpler
method is to apply as water-proofing the gum of the pi&ntilde;on, the
resins of pines, or mineral asphalt. Equal diligence and sagacity
mark the Indians as users of stone. The Shastas heat a stone of
such quality that in cooling it splits into flakes for weapons and
tools. They place an obsidian pebble on an anvil, and with an
agate chisel divide it as they wish; all three being chosen from a
vast diversity of stones which must have been tried and found,
inferior.</p>

<h3>Aluminium and Its Uses.</h3>

<p>From Indian handicrafts, developed by aboriginal skill, patience
and good taste to remarkable triumphs, let us turn to an achievement
of a modern chemist who, calling electricity
to his aid, bestowed a new metal upon
industry, making possible new economies in a
wide sisterhood of arts. Aluminium was discovered
in 1828 by Wohler, a German chemist, who noted its
lightness, toughness, and ductility. At the Centennial Exhibition
at Philadelphia, in 1876, a surveyor&#8217;s transit built of aluminium
was shown, but the metal at that time was six-fold the price of
silver, so that the instrument for some years remained uncopied.
Of course, engineers and mechanics were much interested in a
metal only about one-third as heavy as brass or copper, of white
lustre, and with as much as five-eighths the electrical conductivity
of copper. All that hindered the extensive use of the metal was
its high cost. If that cost could be lowered, at once copper, and
even silver, would face a rival. After many unsuccessful because
expensive processes for obtaining the metal had been devised,
a method was found at once simple and inexpensive.</p>

<p>This method of separating aluminium from its compounds
was devised by Charles M. Hall, while an undergraduate student
at Oberlin College, Ohio. His success turned on his knowledge
of the properties of related metallic compounds. He recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the probable value of aluminium in the arts, could it be produced
in large quantity at low cost. He believed that electrolysis would
prove the most convenient, thorough and inexpensive method;
but there was at that time no process known by which it could
be applied to this element. His problem was to find a form of
electrolyte rich in aluminium which should be comparatively easy
to separate into its elements, and to discover a substance for the
solvent which should prove a satisfactory bath. This latter substance
must, furthermore, be a good conductor of electricity, must
readily dissolve the proposed electrolyte, and must have a higher
resistance to electrolytic disruption than the electrolyte. To discover
the needed substances for electrolyte and solvent involved
the examination of all available compounds of aluminium, the
study of the various possible solvents for the compound selected,
and the determination of electric conductivities. By virtue of
rare familiarity with the chemistry and physics of the subject,
with the properties of every substance concerned, the search was,
after a time, rewarded with complete success. It was found that
bauxite&mdash;the oxide of aluminium, alumina, in fact&mdash;is dissolved
by molten cryolite, the double silicate of aluminium and sodium,
and that the latter, while dissolving the bauxite freely and serving
as an ideal solvent, also itself breaks up under the action of the
electric current at a much higher voltage than alumina. So far
as known, these are the only substances in nature which stand
to each other in such relation as to permit the commercial production
of the metal.</p>

<p>Aluminium as constructive material has disappointed some of
its earlier advocates. It is difficult to work, gumming the teeth
of files and resisting cutting and drilling tools by virtue of the
very toughness which makes it desirable for tubes, columns, and
the like. Its excellences, however, are manifold: the German
army on investigation found that helmets of aluminium, as light
as felt, turned the glancing impact of a bullet. For soldiers&#8217; use
it now forms not only helmets, but cooking vessels, cartridge
cases, buttons, sword and bayonet scabbards. It gives the photographer
as well as the surveyor instruments which unite strength
with lightness. It has furthermore the quality which has long
given value to the lithographic stone of Hohenlofen in Bavaria.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Aluminium takes a sketch as perfectly as does the stone, with
the inestimable advantages that the metal may be readily curved
for a cylinder press, that it is compact and light in storage, while
without the brittleness which has made stone so costly a servant
to both artists and printers. To produce a deep color from stone
it may be necessary to print one impression over another again
and again; from aluminium a single impression is enough, as
severe pressure may be safely applied.</p>

<p>Aluminium has so great an affinity for oxygen as to play a
conspicuous part in the metallurgy of other metals. In the casting
of iron, steel or brass, the addition to each ton of two to five
pounds of aluminium greatly improves the product; the aluminium
by combining with the occluded gases reduces the blowholes and
renders the molten metal more fluid and therefore more homogeneous.
A second use for aluminium turns on the same quality;
it was devised by Dr. Goldschmidt for producing high temperatures,
and is especially useful in welding steel rails and pipes.
A mixture of iron oxide and aluminium finely divided is ignited
by a magnesium ribbon; a very high temperature results as the
aluminium combines with the oxygen derived from the iron oxide.</p>

<p>Aluminium by reason of its lightness occupies a large field in
naval and military equipments, in motor-car construction, and
the like, where the reduction of weight is of paramount importance.
For cooking utensils the use of aluminium is constantly
extending; the metal is a capital conductor of heat, is
not liable to deteriorate in use, and gives rise, if dissolved, to
harmless compounds. The chief objection to aluminium is its
low tensile strength, which, for the cast metal is only 10,000 to
16,000 pounds per square inch. An improvement is effected by
adding as an alloy a small quantity of some other metal, such as
nickel or copper. When one part of aluminium is joined with
nine parts of copper we have aluminium bronze, the strongest
and handsomest of copper alloys, much resembling gold in its
lustre.</p>

<p>Aluminium is finding acceptance as an electrical conductor.
An installation of this kind in Canada unites Shawinigan Falls
with Montreal, 84.3 miles distant. Three cables are employed,
each composed of seven No. 7 wires. The total loss in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
transmission of 8,000-horse power, at 50,000 volts at the generating
station, is about eighteen per cent. Comparing equal conductors,
in round numbers the cross-section of an aluminium
cable is one-and-a-half times that of a copper cable, the weight
being one-half and the tensile strength three-quarters. Everything
considered when aluminium is 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> the price of copper,
the investor is equally served by both metals as conductors. This
is true only where the conductors are bare. Where insulated
cables are needed, the increased diameter of an aluminium conductor
entails extra cost for insulating material.</p>

<h3>Properties at First Unwelcome are Turned to Account.</h3>

<p>At first the lightness and weakness of aluminium were much
against it; these, as we have seen, were soon overcome by alloying
the metal with copper or nickel. But by
giving aluminium forms of utmost stiffness,
by reinforcing these forms with steel wires,
the metal is quite strong and rigid enough for
cups, plates, cameras and other instruments
for which lightness is most desirable. In many another case a
material or a characteristic at first unwelcome has been turned to
excellent account. Smokiness in a fuel is not a quality mentioned
in its advertisements, and yet smokiness is just what is sought in
the twigs, stubble, or coals set on fire to give plants a cloud
protecting them from unseasonable frosts. It is astonishing how
little fuel will serve in such cases, especially if the atmosphere is
calm, so as not to carry the smoke where it is not needed. Many
another instance might be given of a quality objectionable for
one service and then turned to satisfying a new want. Sometimes,
too, offensive qualities are most useful. Illuminating gas,
as at first manufactured, had a distressing odor, which gave
prompt and unmistakable notice of a leak. When water gas came
into use, most harmful when inhaled, the chemists were puzzled
to know how to give it an offensive smell; they found that a
quality long complained of was really an advantage in disguise.</p>

<p>So in the electrical field, when an unsought quality has intruded
itself, and proved unwelcome, the question has arisen, what
service can we enlist it for? Not seldom the answer has been
gainful in the extreme. Dr. Oliver J. Lodge tells us that a bad
electrical contact was at one time regarded simply as a nuisance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
because of the singularly uncertain and capricious character of the
current transmitted by it. Professor Hughes observed its sensitiveness
to sound-waves, and it became the microphone, which,
duly modified, brought the telephone from the whisper of a
curious toy to the full tones which ensured commercial success
the world over. This same &#8220;bad&#8221; contact turns out to be sensitive
to electric waves also, forming indeed nothing else than the
coherer of the wireless telegraph.</p>

<p>Many an electrician has been perplexed and thwarted by the
small bubbles of air which place themselves on a metallic surface
immersed in an electric bath, interrupting the attack sought to
be carried to a finish. Happily there is a task which these very
bubbles perform as if they had been created for no other purpose,
namely, the re-sharpening of files. First the dull and dirty files
are placed for twelve hours in a fifteen to twenty per cent.
solution of caustic soda; they are then cleaned with a scratch-brush
and a five per cent. soda solution. Next they are placed
in a bath of six parts of forty per cent. nitric acid, three parts
sulphuric acid, and 100 parts water, each file being connected
to a plate of carbon immersed close to it, by means of a copper
plate connecting at the top all the carbons and the files. This
produces a short-circuited battery generating gas at the surface
of the files; the bubbles which adhere to the points of the files
protect them from being eaten away, while the rest of the metal
is being etched. Every five minutes the files are taken out and
washed in water to remove the oxide which collects on their
surfaces. When sufficiently etched they are placed in lime-water
to remove any adherent acid, dried in sawdust to prevent rusting,
and rubbed with a mixture of oil and turpentine. Indispensable
in the whole process is the protection afforded by the bubbles
of air.</p>

<h3>Evil, Be Thou My Good.</h3>

<p>For a long time its creation of sparks kept electrical machinery
out of mines liable to fire-damp, which might be exploded by
these sparks. In many other places they
worked evils quite as serious, setting fire to
shavings, cotton and such like. To-day these
very sparks are applied to touching off the charges of gas
and air in gas-engines of all types, whether stationary, or for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
automobiles and motor-boats. In another respect the automobile
should be provided with a means of creating what is usually
considered a nuisance, namely, a noise. Moving rapidly as it
does on thick rubber tires, it gives no warning to hapless wayfarers.
In Canadian cities, where in winter deep snow may muffle
the tread of horses, every sleigh, under severe penalty, must be
furnished with efficient bells.</p>

<h3>Compensating Devices.</h3>

<p>Sometimes an important property has unwelcome effects which,
in particular cases, cannot be applied to advantage, and must be
counterbalanced with as much care as possible.
Many pieces of mechanism from the qualities
of their materials are subject to deviations
which must be compensated by introducing equal and opposite
action. Tasks of this kind proceed upon an intimate acquaintance
with the properties of substances common and uncommon. From
the first making of clocks there was much trouble due to changes
of temperature which affected the dimensions of pendulums, and
consequently their rate of going. This difficulty is overcome by
taking advantage of the fact that heat expands zinc about two-and-a-half
times as much as it expands steel. Accordingly the
two-second pendulum of the great clock at Westminster is built
of a steel rod 179 inches in length, and a zinc tube, less massive,
126 inches long; they are joined at their lower ends only and
are parallel. As temperatures vary, the fluctuations in length
of the steel compensate those which occur in the zinc. Another
mode of effecting the same purpose is to employ a cylinder partly
filled with mercury; as this rises when warmed it exactly compensates
for the lengthening by expansion of its supporting rod
of steel.</p>

<p>Gravity, that universal force at which we have just glanced as
it swings a pendulum, cannot be banished, but its downward
push may be balanced by an equal upward thrust. In a remarkable
feat Plateau poured oil into a blend of water and
alcohol, adding alcohol until he produced a mixture having the
same specific gravity as the oil&mdash;which now became a sphere,
taking its place in the middle of the diluted spirits. He then
introduced into the oil a vertical disc which he rotated; very
soon spherules of oil separated themselves from the parent mass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and as satellites moved in the same direction as the primary
sphere, because immersed as they were in the diluted alcohol,
they shared the direction of its motion: the whole afforded a
remarkable illustration of how nebulae may become planets,
moons, and suns.</p>

<p>On somewhat the same principle as Plateau&#8217;s model are the
liquid compasses for ships. Their needles are disposed within
hollow metallic holders of the same specific gravity as the immersing
liquid, in which therefore they move with perfect freedom
on their sapphire bearings. Sometimes it is desired to use
compass needles so poised that they will respond to the slightest
magnetic influence. To this end one needle is placed above
another, the north pole of the first over the south pole of the
second; the astatic needle formed by this union is much more
sensitive than a simple needle. The astatic needle, for all its
ingenuity, is little used; of incomparably more importance is
that other magnetic device, the telephone. No sooner had it entered
into business than a serious fault was found with its messages;
they arrived blurred and mingled with many sounds and
noises, as if the conveying wire had caught every audibility of a
neighborhood. The difficulty is remedied by using two conductors
instead of one, and so arranging them that the currents
induced on one conductor are exactly equal and opposite to those
induced in the other.</p>

<h3>Properties Long Deemed Useless are Now Gainful.</h3>

<p>If properties at first unwelcome have at last been turned to
account, so also have properties which were long deemed utterly
useless. A big and interesting book might be
filled with the story of how by-products, long
thrown away as worthless, have rewarded careful
study with great profit. Thus for ages was
bran discarded in flour-mills: to-day it may
afford all the miller&#8217;s profit, or even more than that profit. In the
Southern States until a generation ago cotton seed was regarded
as valueless. At present that product, so long wasted, is the basis
of a great industry, a ton of seed yielding about 1089 lbs. of
meat to 20 lbs. of lint; out of this meat 800 lbs. are cake and
meal; the remainder, 289 lbs., forms an oil which furnishes a
substitute for olive oil and lard. Until a few years ago glycerine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
was thrown away as produced in candle-works and soap factories.
It is now so valuable that manufacturers adopt just that method
of preparing fatty acids which yields most glycerine from neutral
fats. So in paper-making, the soda which formerly was sent into
creeks and rivers to the pollution of sources of water-supply, is
now used over and over again, largely increasing the net results
of manufacture. No industry has shown of late years so large
utilization of products formerly wasted as the iron and steel
manufacture. Its slags are made into bricks, cement, and glassy
non-conductors of heat and electricity. Its gases are used for
engines developing immense motive powers, or they are in part
condensed for valuable acids or other compounds. In these cases
and thousands more the question has been, What are the properties
of these by-products? How can they be made useful?</p>

<h3>Separation Turns on Diversity of Properties.</h3>

<p>Let us note how diverse substances are separated from
one another by taking hold of differences in their properties.
When a handful of grain which has just passed
under a flail is thrown upward in a breeze, its
chaff is blown much farther than the grain;
the difference in breadth of surface, joined to
a difference in density, enables the wind to
effect a thorough separation. A common fanning mill, with its
quick air current, works much better than the fitful wind, because
continuously. That simple machine, like every other which takes
a mixture and separates its ingredients, seizes upon a difference
in properties. In Edison&#8217;s apparatus for removing iron from
sand or dust, a series of powerful magnets overhang a stream
of sand or powdered material, deflecting the iron particles so that
they fall into a bin by themselves, while the trash goes into an
adjoining larger bin. The Hungarian process of flour-milling
first crushes wheat through rollers; the various products are then
separated by processes which lay hold of differences in specific
gravity&mdash;often but slight.</p>

<p>A feat more difficult than that of the Hungarian mill would
seem to be the division of diamonds from other stones. It has
been accomplished by Mr. Frederick Kersten of Kimberley, South
Africa. He noticed one day at his elbow a rough diamond and
a garnet on a board. He raised one end of this board, and while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the garnet slipped off, the diamond remained undisturbed. What
was the reason? He observed that the wood bore a coating of
grease, which possibly had held the diamond while the garnet
had slipped away. He took a wider board, greased it, and dropped
upon it a handful of small stones, some of which were rough
diamonds. He found that by inclining the board a little, and
vibrating it carefully, all the stones but the diamonds fell off,
while the diamonds stuck to the grease. He forthwith built a
machine with a greasy board as its separator, and scored a
success.</p>

<p>On quite a different plan is built the coal washer which separates
coal from slate. Pulses of water are sent upward through
a sieve so as to strike a broken mixture of coal and slate, making
a quicksand of the mass. Because the slate is heavier than the
coal it is not carried so far, and is therefore caught in a separate
stream and thrown away.</p>

<h3>Properties Newly Discovered and Produced.</h3>

<p>Separations, such as we just considered, turn upon obvious
differences in density. Properties not obvious, yet highly useful,
come into view year by year as observers grow
more alert and keen, as new instruments are
devised for their aid, as measurements become
more refined, so that matter is constantly found
to be vastly richer in properties than was formerly
supposed. We have long known that carbon has forms
which vary as widely as coal, graphite and the diamond. Many
other elements are detected in a similar masquerade. Iron, for
instance, takes three forms, <i>alpha</i>, <i>beta</i>, and <i>gamma</i>. <i>Alpha</i> iron
is soft, weak, ductile and strongly magnetic; <i>beta</i> iron is hard,
brittle and feebly magnetic; <i>gamma</i> iron is also hard and feebly
magnetic, yet ductile. Joule, the famous English experimenter,
prepared an amalgam of iron with mercury; when he distilled
away the mercury, the remaining iron took fire on exposure to
the air, proving itself to be different from ordinary iron. Moissan
has shown that similar effects follow when chromium, manganese,
cobalt and nickel are released from amalgamation with
mercury.</p>

<p>At first steel was valued for its strength and elasticity; to-day
we also inquire as to its conductivity for heat or electricity, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
behavior in powerful magnetic fields, its capacity to absorb or
reflect rays luminous or other. As art moves onward we enter
upon new powers to change the properties of matter, compassing
new intensities of heat and cold, each with new effects upon
tenacity, elasticity, conductivity. So also with the extreme pressures,
possible only with modern hydraulic apparatus, which
prove marble to be plastic, and reduce wood to a density comparable
with that of coal, explaining how anthracite has been consolidated
from the vegetation of long ago.</p>

<p>And one discovery but breaks the path for another, and so on
indefinitely. Coming upon a new property, the sensitiveness of
silver compounds to light, meant a new means of further discovery,
the photographic plate. That plate, responsive to rays
which fall without response upon the retina, reveals much to us
otherwise unknown and unsuspected. Of old when an observer
saw nothing, he thought there was nothing to see. We know
better now. Thanks to the sensitive plate we have reason to
believe that properties, once deemed exceptional, are really universal.
Phosphorescence, for ages familiar in the firefly, in
decaying logs and fish, now declares itself excitable in all substances
whatever, although usually in but slight measure. The
case is typical: the polariscope, the spectroscope, the fluoroscope,
the magnetometer, the electroscope, each employing as its core
a substance of extraordinary susceptibility, detects that quality
in everything brought within its play. Thus from day to day
matter is disclosed in new wealths of properties, and therefore
in new and corresponding complexities of structure. In ages
past mankind was on nodding terms with many things, and had
no intimate knowledge of anything.</p>

<p>With materials before him richer in array than ever before,
and better understood than of old, the inventor asks, What
properties do I wish in a particular substance? Then, he proceeds
to make, if he can, a dye of unfading permanence, an
insulator resistant to high temperatures, an alloy which when
subjected to heat or cold remains unaltered in dimensions. He
finds materials much more under command than a century ago
could have been imagined, as the glass manufacture, the alloying
industry, the making of artificial dyes, abundantly prove.</p>

<h3>Edison&#8217;s Warehouse as an Aid.</h3>

<p>Mr. Edison, for aid in finding just the substance he needs for
a new purpose, has at his laboratory in Orange, New Jersey, a
large store-room filled with materials of all
kinds. He may wish a particularly high degree
of elasticity, hardness, abrasive power, or what
not; to provide these he has gathered a wide
diversity of woods, ivories, fibres, horn, glass, porcelain, metals
pure and alloyed, alkalis, acids, oils, varnishes and so on. Take
one example from among many which might be given from his
shelves; he finds that a sapphire furnishes the best stylus wherewith
to cut a channel on a phonographic cylinder. Hard, flinty
particles from the air are apt to enter the wax, so as to blunt a
cutting edge. Diamonds would be best as channelers, but their
cost obliges him to choose sapphires as next best; they are purchasable
at reasonable prices and last ten years under ordinary
conditions of wear.</p>

<h3>Light Giving Properties.</h3>

<p>Mr. Edison has achieved triumphs not only in giving sound
its lasting registration, but in producing an electric light of
new economy. Both exploits proceeded upon a masterly knowledge
of properties. A century ago candles provided illumination
both to rich and poor, the sole difference being
that wax shone in the palace and tallow in the
hut. The oil lamps which gleamed in the lighthouses
of England and America, for all their bigness, were plainly
of kin to the Eskimo saucer filled with blubber, edged with moss
as wick. Yet for ages, from every hearth in Christendom, there
had been the promise of better things as bituminous coals, or
sticks of wood, had cheered as much by their light as by their
warmth. We owe much to James Watt, who improved the steam-engine
and gave it essentially the form it retains to the present
hour. We owe also a weighty debt to an assistant of his, William
Murdock, who, thanks to a suggestion from Lord Dundonald,
attentively observed the process by which coals produce
light. He saw that under stress of intense heat the solid fuel
emitted streams of gas which burned with great brilliancy. Here
gas-making and gas-burning went on at the same moment in the
same place; might the process be separated, so that gas might
be made here, and burned elsewhere at any convenient time? An
experiment proved the project to be feasible, and forthwith the
Soho Works, near Birmingham, in which Watt&#8217;s engines were
built, were lighted by gas. Such was the beginning of an industry
now important in many ways. To-day gas not only yields light,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
but heat and power, while, especially in metallurgy, fuels are more
and more used after reduction to the gaseous form.</p>

<h3>How the Gas Mantle was Invented.</h3>

<p>Early in the day of gas-making it was noticed that gases of
various kinds differed much in light-giving quality. It was
presently shown that their light depended on
the carbon brought to incandescence in a flame;
in the absence of that carbon, as when a jet of
pure hydrogen was consumed, extreme heat
was accompanied by no light whatever. Then came a capital discovery,
namely, that lime introduced within a burning jet of
hydrogen became intensely luminous while itself but slowly consumed.
Adopting lime for the core of his apparatus, Captain
Thomas Drummond, of the Royal Engineers, in 1835 devised the
lime light. Upon a block of pure, compressed quick lime, he
directed a jet of burning gas, obtaining a beam of great vividness
still employed in stereopticons and in theatres. For modern types
of the Drummond lamp a twin jet of hydrogen and oxygen is
used. Lime has many sister substances having light-giving quality
when highly heated, and among them are many rare earths,
oxides of uncommon elements. These strange substances were
destined to play a prominent part in the battle between gas and
electricity as illuminants. When Edison in 1878 perfected his
incandescent bulb, it seemed as if electricity were soon to be the
sole illuminator of houses. But the gas engineers were to be
rejoiced by the invention of a mantle which quadrupled the brillancy
of a gas flame, withstanding the rivalry of electricity in a
notable degree. This mantle was invented by Dr. Auer von
Welsbach, a chemist of Vienna, who virtually adopted the principle
of the Drummond light. His efforts give us an admirable
example of an inventor passing from a hint to a test, day after
day meeting new difficulties with unfailing courage and resourcefulness.</p>

<p>In 1880 Dr. von Welsbach took up the study of rare earths,
mainly with a view to ascertaining their value as illuminants. As
he brought one specimen after another to melting heat on bits of
platinum wire, he found that the little beads formed were unfavorable
in shape to the production of light. Then came into
his mind an idea of that golden quality which occurs only to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
man who earns it: Why not soak cotton with solutions of salts of
rare earths, burn the cotton and leave behind an earthy skeleton
of slight thickness and much surface? Experiment proved that
the idea had promise, but the skeletons crumbled to dust with
the least tremor. For success a fair degree of cohesion was imperative,
but to secure that cohesion demanded skill, resource, and
patience. After a long series of trials a mantle was made with
lanthanum oxide; immersed in flame its beam was particularly
bright, now for the first time suggesting that the rare earths
might yield light on a large scale. But trouble was at hand, to
be overcome only at the end of much toil.</p>

<p>During an absence of several days, the inventor left a mantle
of lanthanum oxide locked up in his laboratory. When he returned
it had fallen to powder, having attracted from the atmosphere
both moisture and carbon dioxide. Evidently this harmful
attraction must be avoided by adding an ingredient to keep
the mantle dry and preserve it from union with carbon dioxide.
For this purpose magnesia was chosen; the resulting compound
proved to be durable, and gave an agreeable light of moderate intensity.
But, alas, after glowing about seventy hours, the mantle
failed in its radiance, becoming of glassy and translucent texture.
Thus impeded, the untiring inventor turned to mixtures having
zirconium as a basis; these not only gave a steady beam, but extended
to hundreds of hours the life of a mantle. Still bent on
getting more light if he could, Dr. von Welsbach tested thorium
oxide with gratifying results; yet, strange to say, when he had
purified this material to the utmost, his light fell off in an unaccountable
fashion. What could be the matter? Surely in the
purifying process some invaluable element had been cast aside.
This element, in the researches of an associate, Mr. Ludwig Haitinger,
proved to be cerium in minute quantity. Here was a discovery
of the highest moment; at the end of many experiments
it was determined that one per cent. of cerium and ninety-nine per
cent. of thorium oxide are the best proportions for a mantle such
as we use to-day. Why these proportions are best nobody knows,
any more than why one per cent. of carbon added to iron gives us
a steel incomparably better than iron for many uses. A Welsbach
mantle has good points apart from its economy of gas. Its combustion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
is thorough, so that it throws into the air a much lower
percentage of injurious products than does an ordinary gas flame.
It never smokes, and its light is so steady as to be available for
work with the microscope and other exacting demands. It has
one defect which may yet be removed: its light
has a somewhat unpleasant tinge of green. In
another chapter of this book, producer gas, much
cheaper than common illuminating gas, is described.
Dowson producer gas, with a Welsbach
mantle, yields a light of 8 to 10 candle-power
with a consumption of 4.5 to 4.8 cubic feet per
hour.</p>

<p class="caption">Boivin burner for alcohol, attachable to any lamp.</p>
</div>

<p>Thus far no successful mantle for a petroleum
lamp has been devised. With alcohol a mantle
yields a brilliant flame. A lamp with a Boivin
burner and a Welsbach mantle has given a light
of 30.35 candle-power for 57 hours and 5 minutes
in consuming one gallon of alcohol, almost twice
as much light as given by a Miller lamp with a
round wick and a central draft, burning a gallon
of kerosene. In the United States on January 1,
1907, there will cease to be an excise tax on
alcohol used in the arts, a denaturalizing process
rendering the liquid unfit to drink. As this
alcohol may be easily produced from grain or
potatoes at 20 to 25 cents a gallon, a capital
illuminant will be available for the public, as well
as an excellent fuel and a substitute for gas or
gasoline in motors.</p>

<p>As first manufactured, gas-mantles were
woven, they are now knitted,&mdash;a change for the better in closeness
and firmness of texture. Nearly all the thorium used for
mantles is found in the monazite sands of the provinces of Bahia
and Espirito Santo, along the coast of Brazil. These sands were
for a long time valuable only for the zinc they contained. To-day
the thorium they carry is of vastly more account; for chemical
treatment this is sent to Germany whence the manufactured
product is borne to every quarter of the globe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<h3>Improvements in Electric Lighting: Incandescent Lamps.</h3>

<p>While the Welsbach mantles have been constantly improved
in quality, and given new and inverted forms of special value,
the inventors in the field of electric lighting
have not stood still. For interior illumination
the Edison incandescent bulb still holds its own
despite many a threat of dispossession. Since
1881 its details of manufacture have been
steadily bettered and its price much reduced, while its consumption
of current has fallen from 5.8 watts per candle to 3.1. This
advance, marked as it is, leaves a
long path ahead of the inventor
whose estimate is that were the
whole of an electric current transformed
into light, a candle would
cost us but .11 of a watt, that is, but
one twenty-eighth part as much as
when we set a carbon filament aglow.
In electrical terms a horse-power
yields 748 watts, representing, were
there no waste in conversion, no less
than 425 lamps each of 16 candle-power.</p>

<p class="caption">Alcohol lamp with
ventilating hood.</p>
</div>

<p>It is this immense margin for improvement
that has spurred ingenuity
to attack the problem of
electric lighting from many new
sides. The General Electric Company
produces a carbon filament of
one fifth greater efficiency than an
ordinary untreated filament. Fibers
of the usual cellulose kind are enclosed
in a carbon box, placed in a carbon-tube resistance furnace
heated to between 3,000&deg; and 3,700&deg; C. This converts the filament
into a graphite of increased luminosity which, furthermore,
blackens its enclosing glass much less than a common filament
does.</p>

<img src="images/illo195.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="472" />
<p class="caption">Welsbach mantle.</p>
</div>

<p>In the early days of electric lighting a good many experiments
were tried with threads of platinum, but without success. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
metal remains unmelted at a very high temperature, but as a
light-giver its quality is poor. Of late years investigators have
turned to other metals, of high melting points, and with results
so remarkable that we may expect some of them to be in general
use in the near future. Tantalum, a rare and costly metal, has
been found to give a candle-power with as little as two watts and,
in specially favorable circumstances, with only 1.85 watts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Osmium, in the hands of Dr. Auer von Welsbach, reduces this
figure to 1.5 watts. Dr. Hans Kuzel, of Baden, Austria, has employed
filaments of tungsten in lamps which
he claims demanded only one watt per candle.
From among these new lamps it seems
highly probable that as soon as methods of
manufacture are settled and standardized
the world will be given an electric light, in
small units, much cheaper than ever before.</p>

<h3>New Arc Lamps.</h3>

<p>For large spaces indoors and for out
of doors the arc-lamp maintains its popularity
in much the form
originally devised by
Mr. Charles F. Brush of
Cleveland. But, as in the case of the incandescent
bulb, many a rival is now disputing
the field, so that supersedure may be
close at hand. In what are known as flaming or luminous arcs
the carbon pencils are impregnated with salts of the calcium
group of elements, of extreme luminosity.
In these lamps the electric arc itself is the
chief source of light, instead of the
glowing end of the positive carbon as
in a common arc lamp. As the calcium
salts volatilize into gases they provide
a path of less resistance than air for the
passage of the current, so that the electrodes
may be drawn apart to a distance
which may be as much as 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches. These
lamps require free ventilation, so that they
must be open. Their economy is extraordinary,
a candle-power being afforded for
.353 watt, as against 1.78 watts for an enclosed
arc lamp, a five-fold gain in effectiveness.
To renew the carbons, which
waste rapidly, a new device provides
fresh pencils, cartridge fashion, as required.
Without this aid, trimming is often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
necessary, and this fact joined to the high cost of the carbons
lessens the net gain in their use. On another line of experiment
noteworthy results have been reached with metallic oxides.
Magnetite, an oxide of iron, has developed a candle-power with
but one half of one watt. Ferro-titanium, a compound of iron
and titanium, has given a candle-power with only one third of a
watt, and it is expected that still higher efficiencies will soon be
attained with this wonderful compound.</p>

<p class="caption">Hewitt mercury-vapor
lamp.</p>
</div>

<h3>Hewitt Mercury-Vapor Lamp.</h3>

<p>From quite another side Mr. Peter Cooper Hewitt enters the
field of light production, utilizing the glow of a vapor instead of
a solid stick. His lamp is a long, slender tube of glass; within
each end is sealed a metallic wire; at one end is a little mercury.
When a powerful pump has exhausted the tube to a high degree
it is sealed, and its wire terminals are placed
in an electric circuit. On tilting the tube the
mercury flows from end to end, an arc is
formed, and the mercury vapor becomes luminous. This vapor
remains unconsumed, and the lamp asks no attention whatever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Its rays are greenish, so that where normal colors are desired, it
is well to use supplementary lamps of carbon filaments to furnish
red rays. For streets, squares, freight-sheds and the like, the
Hewitt light is capital just as produced, its rays being widely
diffused and casting no heavy shadows. Its high actinic power
makes it specially useful to photographers, while in factories,
drafting rooms, composing rooms and so on, its color is unobjectionable.
Its cost is small, as a candle-power is produced in
large tubes with but 0.55 of a watt. A Hewitt lamp of automatic
type, recently devised, has a small solenoid or magnet on the suspension
bar just above the holder. On closing the circuit the current
flows through this solenoid which instantly tilts the tube and
starts the light. This lamp is particularly suited to places, such
as the lofty ceilings of foundries, where it would be difficult to
tilt the tube by hand. Hewitt lamps use either a direct or an
alternating current.</p>

<p>In an <a href="#Page_72">earlier chapter</a> we glanced at reflectors and refractors,
newly invented, which give light its most useful paths with as
little avoidable loss as possible. These devices, applied to Welsbach
burners and the new electric lamps, greatly economize
modern illumination in comparison with that of former times.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
PROPERTIES&mdash;<i>Continued</i>. STEEL</h2>

<p class="chaptoc">Its new varieties are virtually new metals, strong, tough, and heat resisting
in degrees priceless to the arts .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Minute admixtures in other
alloys are most potent.</p>

<p class="chapstart">From a brief consideration of illuminants let us pass to a
rapid survey of a most important group of structural materials,
the steels. Here, as always, we shall find how abundant are
the harvests reaped in a searching study of properties. Within
the past fifty years new steels have been produced in so ample
and rich a variety that we have gained what are virtually many
new metals of inestimable qualities.</p>

<h3>Steels for Strength.</h3>

<p>In 1781 Professor Torbern Bergman, of the University of
Upsala, in Sweden, showed that steel mainly differs from iron
in containing about one fifth of one per cent. of plumbago, or carbon,
as we would say now. Steels may contain all the way from
one tenth to one and a half per cent. of carbon;
the lower this percentage, the more nearly does
the steel approach wrought iron in softness;
as the proportion of carbon increases up to one per cent. the
steel increases in tenacity, beyond one per cent. tenacity diminishes
and brittleness is augmented. Hardness depends upon the
percentage of carbon a steel contains. Physical conditions are
almost as important as chemical composition; a mass of red-hot
steel, carefully hammered or pressed is thereby strengthened, an
effect due either to minimizing the process of crystallization, or to
breaking up crystals as fast as they form. The microscope reveals
many details of structure in steel, and has enabled the
analysts greatly to economize the manufacture of desired
varieties. Under the microscope steels much resemble crystalline
rocks in structure, with constituents differing widely. Of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the most important is ferrite, a pure or nearly pure metallic iron,
soft, weak, ductile, of high electric conductivity. Next in importance
is cementite, an iron carbide (Fe<sub>3</sub>C), harder than glass
and nearly as brittle, but probably very strong under gradually
and axially applied stress. A third constituent, austenite, is a
solid solution of carbon, or perhaps of an iron carbide, in <i>gamma</i>
allotropic iron (there being also <i>alpha</i> and <i>beta</i> irons). Austenite
is hard and brittle when cold, is stable at high temperatures,
and is slowly transformed by reaction into compounds of ferrite
or cementite. Several other ingredients of importance, as <a href="#Fig157">pearlite</a>,
illustrated on the opposite page, have also been studied.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a

Published by Albert Sauveur, Cambridge, Mass., 1906.</p></div>

<p>While carbon is the most decisive element in admixture, other
ingredients have marked influence, silicon and manganese especially.
The process invented by Bessemer, described by himself
in <a href="#Page_401">another chapter</a> of this book, as introduced in 1855, revolutionized
the steel manufacture by its directness, cheapness and speed.
It consists in burning out from pig-iron, by a hot air blast, all
or nearly all its carbon. Then spiegeleisen, or other mixture,
containing a definite quantity of carbon and manganese, is added
to the molten mass, yielding steel of the quality desired. This
method produces more rails for railroads than any competing
method; in other fields it is being rivalled more and more severely
by the open hearth process.</p>

<h3>The Open Hearth Process.</h3>

<p>Steel making by the open hearth process is chiefly due to the
late Sir William Siemens. In a gas producer he gave his fuel
the gaseous form, in which it is more easily
controlled and more efficient than when solid.
Of more importance were his regenerators,
chambers of brickwork, heated by the products of combustion, and
then employed to warm incoming currents of air and gas on their
way to the furnace. The Siemens furnace has been modified in
many ways and much improved in its details. A good example
of an <a href="#Fig159">open hearth furnace</a>, as planned by the late Mr. Bernard
Dawson, is shown on page 165. It centers in a large hearth built
of refractory materials, upon which the metal is melted as flames
play over it. At each end are two regenerators filled with checker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
firebricks through which air or gas passes on its way to the furnace,
and through which, at due intervals, the products of combustion
emerge as they pass to the stack. On each side, one of
the regenerators is for air, the other for gas; between them is
a substantial wall to prevent any mixing before their currents
reach the hearth. It is in the regenerator, which utilizes heat which
otherwise would be wasted, that the open hearth displays its best
feature. Its products vary in composition as its raw materials
vary, whether pig-iron of a specific kind, a particular ore, or
scrap; and just as in the Bessemer process, a harmful element, as
phosphorus, is removed almost wholly by the addition of a suitable
ingredient, such as lime. In excellence and uniformity of
quality open hearth steels are preferred to those of the Bessemer
converter, even for railroad rails which for years were made
solely by the Bessemer process.</p>

<h3>The Gayley Dry-Blast Process.</h3>

<p>A remarkable improvement in blast-furnace practice, cheapening
cast or pig-iron, and therefore lowering the cost of derived
steels, is the dry-blast process due to Mr. James
Gayley, of Pittsburg. It has long been known
that blast-furnaces ask more fuel in warm and
damp weather than in cold and dry weather;
beginning with this familiar fact Mr. Gayley proceeded to dry the
air blown into his furnaces, by passing it around large coils of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
iron pipes through which a freezing mixture circulated, melting
the snow as formed by passing hot brine through the pipes, a few
of them at a time. The air thus dried was then heated by being
sent through hot blast stoves in the usual mode. This simple
drying of the blast saves about 19 per cent. of the fuel, and makes
the action of the furnace much more regular than when ordinary
air is used. It lowers the temperature of the gases which escape
from the top of the furnace, and raises their percentage of carbon
dioxide, symptoms of the great increase in fuel efficiency. Atmospheric
moisture has a cooling effect on the lower part of a furnace,
just where the highest temperature is needed to melt the
iron and slag, remove the sulphur and deoxidize the silica. A
comparatively small increase of temperature by broadening the
margin of effective heat, which margin at best is narrow, has the
astonishing effect of economizing fuel to the extent stated, 19
per cent.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<h3>Steels to Order.</h3>

<p>What is chiefly sought in steel is tensile strength, next in value
is elasticity; in some cases hardness is indispensable. By varying
the proportions of the carbon, silicon and manganese
added to his iron, the steel-maker produces
an alloy with the tenacity, elasticity or
hardness he wishes. Nickel, as a further ingredient, in certain
proportions yields an astonishing gain. A steel containing fifteen
per cent. of nickel has shown a tensile strength of 244,000 pounds
to the square inch, four times as much as before admixture; the
elastic limit also was much increased. Hardness and strength
tend to exclude ductility, but nickel steel is at once strong, hard
and extremely ductile; hence its use for armor plate, great guns,
and the barrels of small arms. Nothing but the high price of nickel
prevents these alloys from having wide utilization, for they mean
lighter and therefore more economical machines and engines than
those of ordinary steel. Many turbines actuated by water, steam
or gas, are best operated at speeds forbidden to common steel,
which would fly to pieces under the centrifugal stress exerted,
yet these speeds are quite feasible and safe when nickel steel is
employed. This alloy brings nearer the day of mechanical flight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
first promising to transportation on land and sea engines increased
in power while much diminished in weight. In exceptional cases,
where the expense may be borne, we may expect soon to see nickel
steel used for higher towers, longer bridge-spans, thinner boilers,
than those of to-day. Part of the bridge crossing Blackwell&#8217;s
Island, New York, is built of nickel steel. Even with costs at
their present plane, it is worth while for the designer of machinery
to remember that friction is reduced when masses become smaller,
power for power. It is found profitable, for instance, to use
nickel steel for the cylinders of automobiles of high power.</p>

<p>In many tools and implements two different kinds of steel are
united with decided gain. Thus the cutting edge of a cold chisel
is hard and brittle, while its shank, much less hard, is tough and
able to resist the shocks it receives. So also a projectile is hardened
at its point and nowhere else. Plowshares are often made
very hard on their surfaces, with a backing which is comparatively
soft but elastic enough to suffer no harm in the blows dealt by
rough ground and stones. One of the drawbacks in the use of
steel is its liability to corrosion. An alloy of 30 per cent. nickel
and 70 per cent. steel has proved to be corrodible in but slight
measure, affording a material of great value to the arts.</p>

<h3>Heat Treatment.</h3>

<p>While the chemical composition of a steel is of prime importance,
the quality of the steel will next depend upon its heat treatment
in manufacture. The temperature to
which heating is carried, the period during
which it is maintained, the rate at which cooling
takes place, and the circumstances of cooling, each has its
effect on the character of the product. It is chiefly in this field
that the steel-maker within wide limits is able to turn out an alloy
either hard or soft, brittle or ductile, tenacious or weak, at pleasure.
While much has been learned within the past few years as
to the proper treatment of steel by heat, much still remains to be
discovered.</p>

<p>To quote typical instances from Professor Henry Marion Howe,
of Columbia University, New York<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;In the case of steel with
less than 0.33 per cent. of carbon the temperature from which slow
cooling occurs appears to have little influence on the tensile
strength; but it is the general belief that if that temperature approaches<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the melting-point, the tensile strength decreases. In
the case of higher-carbon steel, the tensile strength at first increases
as the temperature from which slow cooling occurs rises
to 800&deg;, or even to 900&deg; or 1000&deg; C. Then, after varying somewhat,
it falls off very abruptly in the case of steel of 0.50 per cent.
of carbon, when that temperature approaches 1400&deg;.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a

<h3>Tempering and Annealing.</h3>

<p>For rock drills, cold chisels, milling and other tools it is necessary
to use steel carefully tempered, so that brittleness is greatly
reduced while considerable hardness and cutting
power remain. Other changes of properties,
as remarkable, follow upon subjecting
steel to greater heat than that used for tempering. Says Professor
Roberts-Austen<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;Three strips of steel identical in quality
are taken. By bending one it is shown to be soft; if it is heated
to redness and plunged in cold water it will become hard and
will break on any attempt to bend it. The second strip, after heating
and rapid cooling, if again heated to about the melting point
of lead, will at once bend readily, but will spring back to a
straight line when the bending force is removed. The third piece
may be softened by being cooled slowly from a bright red heat,
and this will bend easily and remain distorted. The metal has
been singularly altered in its properties by comparatively simple
treatment, and all these changes, it must be remembered, have
been produced in a solid metal to which nothing has been added,
and from which nothing has been taken away.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is the comparative slowness of cooling in oil, the greater
slowness of cooling in air, that make these by far the best tempering
processes, because the molecular re-arrangement, in which
tempering consists, requires time. Often the critical temperature,
at which a desired re-arrangement takes place, is declared by the
metal losing all power of response to a magnet: this fact affords
the steel-maker welcome aid; he has only to shut off heat as soon
as his steel ceases to attract a magnet and plunge the steel into
water in order to obtain the hardness he wishes.</p>

<p>The complex phenomena of heat treatment in steel manufacture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
are fully discussed by Professor H. M. Howe, in his &#8220;Iron, Steel
and Other Alloys,&#8221; second edition, 1906.</p>

<h3>Steel for Railroad Rails.</h3>

<p>In another chapter of this book a word is said as to the form
of rails at which Mr. P. H. Dudley has arrived as the outcome
of years of experiment. He thus describes the
properties which the steel should possess by
virtue of due chemical composition and proper
heat treatment<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Ductility to ensure power to resist the shock of the driving
wheels, so that the steel may not break; resistance to abrasion,
that it may not wear out; and high limit of elasticity, that it may
not take a permanent set and be bent into a series of waves between
its supporting ties, by the enormous pressures which the
wheels of to-day throw upon it. The best composition is carbon
0.55 to 0.60 per cent., silicon 0.10 to 0.15, manganese 1.20, sulphur
under 0.06, phosphorus under 0.06; with 50,000 to 60,000 granulations
to the square inch. More granulations, or fewer, mean an
increase of brittleness in the steel.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a

<h3>Invar: A Steel Invariable in Dimensions Whether Warmed or Cooled.</h3>

<p>While the great strength of steel makes it of pre-eminent
value in the arts, steel in the huge dimensions of modern roofs
and bridges has the demerit of expanding with
heat and contracting with cold in a troublesome
degree. A notable case is that of the steel
rails on the elevated railroad of New York.
If this fault, common to all metals, can be
materially reduced or abolished, then steel
enters upon a new field of golden harvests. Here, by dint of
acumen and skill the goal has been reached by M. Charles
Edouard Guillaume, of the International Bureau of Weights and
Measures in Paris. A few years ago he began investigating the
singular magnetic qualities of nickel-steels. Then in studying
expansibility by heat he discovered that when the nickel was increased
to 36.2 per cent. the alloy was almost indifferent to
changes of temperature, expanding but one part in one million
when warmed from zero to 1&deg; Centigrade. Because of this insensibility,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the alloy at the suggestion of Professor Thury is
named <i>invar</i>. In observations of invar which extended through
six years, an elongation of one part in 100,000 was detected;
subsequently its changes of length each year seemed less than
one-millionth. This slight inconstancy may be overcome by
further experiment; in the meantime while invar is not available
for standards of length of the first order, such as those of the
Bureau of Standards at Washington, there is a vast and useful
field for the alloy. It offers itself for secondary standards, to be
compared at intervals with primary standards at Washington or
other capitals of the world.</p>

<p>A leading application will be in surveying. Already wires of
invar have been employed by the Survey of France with the utmost
success, dispensing with the burdensome apparatus formerly
needed in compensating variations due to temperature.
With invar wires ten men have advanced at the rate of five
kilometers a day; ten years before, with ordinary steel measures,
fifty men advanced one half a kilometer, that is, with but
one fiftieth as much efficiency.</p>

<p>In time-keeping invar is likely to be as valuable as in surveying.
At the Bureau of Standards and the Naval Observatory
at Washington, pendulums of invar have been adopted with
gratifying results. In ordinary watches and clocks the alloy will
banish the compensating devices now requisite, of brass and steel
which expand with heat and shrink with cold. For chronometers
of the highest grade it is desirable that invar be improved with
respect to its stability, an improvement which appears to be highly
probable.</p>

<p>One other discovery by M. Guillaume deserves a word. He
has found a nickel-steel which when warmed has the same expansibility
as glass, so that it may displace platinum wire in leading
an electric current into an incandescent lamp, a Crookes&#8217; tube
or similar illuminator. More singular still is another of his
nickel-steels which shrinks slightly when warmed, holding out
the hope of finding an alloy which will neither shrink nor expand
as its temperature rises. With such a substance, of trustworthy
stability, the arts would have a working material of inestimable
value for theodolites, frames for microscopes and telescopes,
and cameras for exact picturing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<h3>Manganese Steel.</h3>

<p>The magnetic properties of steel, to-day of supreme importance,
have for ages excited curiosity. As long ago as 1774, Rinman
observed that steel alloyed with manganese
is non-magnetic. Here was a material
for time-pieces which would free them from
magnetic derangement. In the hands of Mr. R. A. Hadfield, of the
Hecla Works, Sheffield, England, manganese steel has been produced
in remarkable varieties. As the proportion of manganese
is increased, the alloys manifest singular changes in their properties.
When the manganese is four to six per cent., and the
carbon less than one-half per cent., the alloy is brittle enough to
be readily powdered by a hand hammer. When the proportion of
manganese is doubled, the alloy displays great strength, which
reaches its maximum when the manganese is fourteen per cent.
No other material approaches manganese steel in its ability to
resist abrasion; it outwears ordinary steel four times, much reducing
the need for repairs, renewals, or pauses in work while
worn-out parts are being replaced. It gives equally good service
as the pins and bushings of dredges of the bucket-ladder type,
lifting gold-bearing gravels and sands. It is used for centrifugal
pumps in dredging sandy harbors, slips, or ponds, where the grit
borne in the water plays havoc with ordinary steel surfaces. In
ore-crushing manganese steel is particularly effective; a pair of
jaws built of it have crushed 21,000 tons of flinty ore and were
still good for 4,000 to 6,000 tons more, while the best chilled iron
plates failed to crush as little as 4,000 tons.</p>

<p>This alloy is so hard that it cannot be machined or drilled by
ordinary means; it must be treated by emery or carborundum
wheels. Yet it is so malleable that it can be used for rivets when
headed cold. It is so tough that it may be bent and twisted at
will without rupture, so that it forms railroad switches, frogs,
and crossings of great durability.</p>

<h3>High-Speed Tool Steels.</h3>

<p>Until 1868, the steel tools used in lathes and drills, planers and
so on, were limited to the moderate pace at which they remained
cool enough to keep their temper. Beyond that
quiet gait they became worthless, snapped
apart, or melted as if wax. In 1868 Robert
Forester Mushet, of the Titanic Steel and Iron Company, Coleford,
England, discovered an alloy of steel, tungsten and manganese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
which took rough cuts at a depth and with a speed unknown
before. This alloy, because hardened simply in air, was
called &#8220;air-hardening&#8221; or &#8220;self-hardening.&#8221; Thirty years afterward
at the Bethlehem Steel Works, Pennsylvania, a tool of this
steel was heated to what was feared to be a ruinously high temperature;
experiment proved that the tool could be used at a
heat, and therefore at a speed, never attained before in the workshop.
From that hour hundreds of investigators have proceeded
to combine steel with tungsten in various percentages, adding
manganese, molybdenum, chromium, silicon, and vanadium. Of
these ingredients much the most important are tungsten and
molybdenum. Particular pains must be taken thoroughly to anneal
the alloy when worked into bars.</p>

<p>As to the gain introduced by high-speed tool steels let Mr.
J. M. Gledhill testify from the experience of the Sir W. G. Armstrong,
Whitworth &amp; Company&#8217;s works at Manchester<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Formerly where forgings were first made and then machined
with ordinary self-hardening steel, a production, from bars
eighteen and one half by six and five eighth inches, of eight bolts
in ten hours was usual. With the new steel forty similar bolts
from the rolled bar are now turned out in the same time, further
abolishing the cost of first rough forging the bolt to form. The
speed is 160 feet a minute, the depth of cut three-quarter inch,
of feed <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>32</sub> inch, the weight removed from each bolt sixty-two
pounds, or 2,480 pounds per day, the tool being ground only once
in that time. This is a fairly typical case. Just as striking is the
behavior of this steel in twist drills, which supersede the punching
process by passing through stacks of thin steel plates quite as
swiftly and economically as a punch, while avoiding the liability
to distress which accompanies the action of a punch.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the quickening of pace due to these steels, the designer
is asked to remodel machine tools so that they may stand up
against new pressures and speeds. A lathe thus re-patterned is
mentioned by Mr. Gledhill: it absorbs sixty-five horse power as
against twelve formerly, and has a belt trebled in width so as to
measure twelve inches. Mr. Oberlin Smith expects high-speed
steel to have other effects on machine design than the conferring
of new strength: he looks for a rivalry keener than ever between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
rotary and reciprocating tools. In his judgment the milling tool,
which can be speeded indefinitely, will encroach more and more
on the planer, limited as the planer is by its movement being to
and fro.</p>

<p>When work on cast iron must proceed at the utmost pace, a jet
of air, delivered to the chips with force enough to clear them off
as fast as they are formed, enables the speed to be quickened,
while, at the same time, the life of the cutter is lengthened.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a

The foregoing pages on steel have been revised by Professor Bradley
Stoughton, of the School of Mines, Columbia University, New York. He
contributes at the end of this chapter a brief <a href="#Page_176">list of books</a> for the reader
who may wish to know something of the literature of iron and steel.</p></div>

<h3>Alloys for Electro-Magnets.</h3>

<p>In electrical art the alloy employed for electro-magnets should
be permeable by magnetism fully and easily, otherwise dynamos
and motors will waste energy as their magnetism
is constantly gained, lost, or reversed.
Once more the experimenter is Mr. Robert
A. Hadfield of Sheffield, who produces an
excellent alloy by uniting iron with 2.75 per cent. silicon, .08
per cent. manganese, .03 per cent. sulphur, .03 per cent. phosphorus.
This alloy is improved by being heated to between 900&deg;
and 1100&deg; C., followed by quick cooling; then being reheated to
between 700&deg; to 800&deg; C., and cooled very slowly.</p>

<p>Iron is largely used as an electrical conductor, so that it is well
to know how its conductivity is affected by ordinary admixtures.
In experiments with sixty-eight specimens, Professor W. F. Barrett
alloyed iron separately with carbon, aluminium, silicon, chromium,
manganese, nickel, cobalt, and tungsten. In every case
there was a loss of conductivity, and usually in a degree proportioned
to the atomic weight of the added ingredient. Between
one element and another there was often a wide disparity of
effect. For example, in admixtures, each of one per cent., tungsten
increased the resistance of a conductor by two per cent.,
while aluminium did seven-fold as much harm.</p>

<h3>Magnetic Alloys of Non-Magnetic Ingredients.</h3>

<p>We have so long been accustomed to thinking that there must
be iron in everything magnetic that we hear with astonishment
that metals each insusceptible of magnetism, when united strongly
display this property. Such is the discovery of Mr. Fr. Heusler,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
of Dillenburg, near Wiesbaden. He noticed one day that an alloy
of manganese, tin, and copper adhered to a tool which he had
accidentally magnetized. In the course of experiments
Mr. Heusler found that carbon, silicon,
and phosphorus did not confer magnetism;
while arsenic, antimony, and bismuth did
so, all three metals being diamagnetic,
that is, placing themselves at right angles to a common steel
magnet above which they are freely suspended. An alloy of remarkable
magnetic strength was composed of copper 61.5 per
cent., manganese 23.5 per cent., and aluminium 15 per cent. This
alloy is brittle and considerable changes of temperature but
slightly affect its magnetism. When a little lead is added magnetism
disappears between 60&deg; and 70&deg; C. This alloy therefore is
magnetic when placed in cold water; when the water is heated the
magnetism disappears before the water boils, only to reappear
when the water cools. The main interest of these discoveries is
that the new alloys bridge the gap betwixt magnetic and diamagnetic
bodies, that is, they join the iron, nickel, and cobalt
group, which place themselves along the line of a magnetic field,
with the diamagnetic elements, bismuth, antimony, zinc, tin, lead,
silver, and arsenic, which place themselves at right angles to the
lines of a magnetic field. We have been accustomed to suppose
that magnetism is a property possessed by only a few elements;
these alloys show us that magnetism may arise as a result of
grouping atoms, none of which by itself has any magnetism whatever.
Indeed it may be possible to make an alloy more magnetic
than iron, furnishing the electrician with electro-magnets of new
power.</p>

<h3>Anti-Friction Alloys.</h3>

<p>We have briefly glanced at recent progress in the art of alloying
in so far as it has produced steels of new strength, elasticity,
or hardness; new ability to resist abrasion or
high temperatures, new capacity for magnetism,
new indifference to changes of temperature
as affecting dimensions. Alloying has of late years conferred
other gifts upon industry, of which one example may be cited
from among many of equal importance. Friction levies so
grievous a tax upon the mechanic and the engineer that they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
quick to seize upon any material for bearings which reduces
friction. As the result of extensive experiments Dr. C. B. Dudley
recommends an alloy of tin, copper, a little phosphorus, with ten
to fifteen per cent. of lead. He finds the loss of metal by wear
under uniform conditions diminishes as the lead is increased and
the tin diminished.</p>

<h3>Influence of Minute Admixtures.</h3>

<p>We have seen how remarkably the properties of iron are affected
by minute additions of carbon which may be assumed to
enter into chemical union with the metal. The
properties of other metals may be influenced
by minute quantities of added elements, although
in quantities so small as to preclude
the possibility of their forming ordinary chemical compounds.
It by no means follows, however, that the atom of an added
element does not exert a direct influence. In Professor Roberts-Austen&#8217;s
laboratory, in London, two ladles were filled with exceptionally
pure bismuth; into one ladle a tiny fragment of tellurium
was placed. The ladles were poured each into a separate
mold, and when the metal became cold it was fractured by a hammer.
The bismuth to which the tellurium was added had become
minutely crystalline; while that which remained pure had crystallized
in broad mirror-like planes. One reflected light as a
mirror; the other, containing the tellurium, scattered the light it
received. With no guidance but that of mere inspection, one
would have said that the two substances were distinct elements,
and yet the only difference was that one contained <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2000</sub> part of
tellurium and the other no tellurium at all.</p>

<p>Submarine telegraphy presents us with a case as striking: were
its copper wire to contain but one-thousandth part of bismuth,
the line would be so much reduced in conductivity as to be commercially
worthless: quite as harmful are mixtures of antimony.
In coining, the addition to gold of one five-hundredth part by
weight of bismuth produces an alloy which crumbles under the
die and refuses to take an impression. In the manufacture of
such dies it is necessary to employ a steel containing 0.8 to 1 per
cent. of carbon and no manganese. It is usual, says Professor
Roberts-Austen, to water-harden and temper it to a straw color,
and a really good die will strike 40,000 coins without being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
fractured or deformed, but if the steel contains 0.1 per cent. too
much carbon, it would not strike 100 pieces without cracking, and
if it contained 0.2 per cent. too little carbon, it would probably
be hopelessly distorted and its engraved surface destroyed in the
attempt to strike a single coin. As in coining so in steam-engineering.
A little arsenic added to copper improves it for the
fire-boxes of locomotives. Boilers of old, formed of copper
slightly admixed with sulphur, lasted longer than modern boilers
built of copper free from sulphur. Antimony behaves like
arsenic, and in due proportion strengthens copper; bismuth, on
the contrary, weakens copper, and a perceptible effect is wrought
by a mere trace. Nickel is made malleable by adding extremely
small quantities of phosphorus, magnesium, or zinc.</p>

<h3>Jena Glass.</h3>

<p>As in the case of the aluminium bronzes and nickel steels,
alloys of the utmost value have been formed by introducing
new ingredients, often in little more than traces, or by modifying
but slightly the proportions in which ingredients long familiar
have been mingled together. An equal gain
has followed upon varying anew the composition
of glass. For centuries the only materials
added to sand for its melting pot were silicic acid, potash, soda,
lead-oxide, and lime. As optical research grew more exacting
the question arose, Will new ingredients give us lenses of better
qualities? First of all came the demand for glasses which combined
in lenses would yield images in the telescope and microscope
free from color. In a simple lens, such as that of an ordinary
reading glass, we can readily observe the production of
color by a common beam of light. The rays of different colors,
which make up white light, are refrangible in different degrees,
so that while the violet rays come to a focus near the lens, the
red rays have their focus farther off; the images, therefore, instead
of being sharply defined, are surrounded by faint colored
rings. In a telescope or microscope a simple lens would be of
no value from the indistinctness of its images. To correct this
dispersion of color a second lens of opposite action is placed behind
the first, that is, a crown-glass lens is added to a flint-glass
lens. (See <a href="#Fig197">cut</a>, p. 255.) This remedy is not quite perfect for
the reason that the distribution of the spectrum from violet to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
red varies with each kind of glass, and in such a way that through
failure of correspondence, color to color, in a compound lens,
variegated fringes of light, though faint, are perceptible, much
to the annoyance of the microscopist, the astronomer, and the
photographer.</p>

<p>With a view to producing glasses which united in compound
lenses should be color free, Rev. Vernon Harcourt, an English
clergyman, in 1834 began experiments which he continued for
twenty-five years. By using boron and titanium in addition to
ordinary ingredients of glass, he produced lenses less troubled by
color than any that had before been made. His labors, only in
part successful, were in 1881 followed by those of Professor Ernst
Abbe and Dr. Otto Schott at Jena. With resources provided by
the Government of Prussia, these investigators were able to do
more for the science and art of glass-making than all the workers
who stood between them and the first melters of sand and soda.
They immensely diversified the ingredients employed, carefully
noting the behavior of each new glass, how much light it absorbed,
how it behaved in damp air, what strength it had, how it
retained its original qualities during months of keeping, and in
particular how variously colored rays were distributed throughout
its field of dispersion. As in the blending of new alloys it was
found that many of these novel combinations were useless. Of
the scores of new glasses produced some were extremely brittle,
others were easily tarnished by air, or so soft as to refuse to be
shaped as prisms or ground as lenses. A more systematic plan of
experiment was therefore adopted: for the production of new
glasses there were by degrees separately introduced in varied
quantities, carefully measured, boron, phosphorus, lithium, magnesium,
zinc, cadmium, barium, strontium, aluminium, berylium,
iron, manganese, cerium, didymium, erbium, silver, mercury, thallium,
bismuth, antimony, arsenic, molybdenum, niobium, tungsten,
tin, titanium, fluorine, uranium. An early and cardinal discovery
was that the relation between refraction and dispersion may be
varied almost at will. For example, boron lengthens the red end
of the spectrum relatively to the blue; while fluorine, potassium,
and sodium have the opposite effect. With the distribution of the
diverse hues of the spectrum thus brought under control, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
were produced glasses which, when united as compound lenses,
were almost perfectly color-free, rendering images with a new
sharpness of definition. Yet more: in their unceasing round of
experiments Professor Abbe and Dr. Schott came upon glass so
little absorbent of light that combinations of much thickness intercepted
only a small fraction of a beam; they were indeed almost
perfectly transparent. This achievement is of great importance to
the photographer, whose planar combination of six lenses may be
four inches in thickness. At Jena the researchers are endeavoring
to perfect another gift for the camera: they seek to produce
glasses each transmitting but one color, for service in color-photography.</p>

<p>To microscopy they have recently given lenses which completely
transmit ultra-violet rays so as to photograph the diffraction discs
of objects, such as gold particles in colloidal solutions, otherwise
invisible, because below the resolving power of the most powerful
microscope. It is estimated that with this new aid an object but
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>250,000,000</sub> of a millimeter in length may indirectly be brought
to view.</p>

<p>One ancient art, that of annealing glass, Professor Abbe and
Dr. Schott greatly improved, eliminating from their products the
stresses which distort an image. By means of an automatic heat-regulator,
the temperature of a batch of glass could be kept steadily
for any desired period at any point between 350&deg; and 477&deg; C.;
or allowed to fall uniformly at any prescribed rate. The glass
was usually contained in a very thick cylindrical copper vessel,
on which played a large gas flame. The highest temperature
found necessary to banish stress, that is, to cause softening to
begin, was 465&deg; C. The lowest temperature required to ensure
complete hardening was about 370&deg; C. Thus the temperatures of
solidification all lie between 370&deg; and 465&deg;. This fall of 95&deg; was
spread over an interval of four weeks, instead of a few days as
formerly, with the result that stress was banished utterly.</p>

<p class="caption">THE LATE PROFESSOR ERNEST ABBE, OF JENA.</p>
</div>

<p>A practical example of the benefits gained in the properties of
Jena glass is exhibited by its use in measuring heat. A thermometer
of common glass when first manufactured may tell the truth,
and in a month or two may vary from truth so much as to be
worthless. The reason is that the dimensions of the glass slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
change day by day, as in a less degree do those of many alloys.
It was one of the aims of the Jena laboratory to produce a glass
which should remain constant in its dimensions while exposed to
varying temperatures, so that, made into thermometers, it would
be thoroughly trustworthy. Here, too, success was attained, so
that thermometers of Jena glass are found to be reliable as are no
instruments of ordinary glass. This product is available for astronomical
lenses, otherwise liable to serious changes of form as
exposed successively to warmth and cold.</p>

<p>Heat was to be staunchly withstood not only in moderate variations,
but in extreme degrees. From time immemorial heat suddenly
applied to glass has riven it in pieces. Could art dismiss
this ancient fault? To-day a beaker from Jena may be filled with
ice and placed with safety on a gas flame. In its many varieties
this glass furnishes the chemist with clean, transparent and untarnishing
vessels for the delicate tasks of the laboratory, all of
singular indifference to heat and cold. Yet again. Special kinds
of this glass in chemical uses are attacked by cold or hot corrosive
liquids only one-twelfth to one-fourth as much as good Bohemian
glass, the next best material.</p>

<p>Not only to heat but to light Jena glass renders a service. Glass
of ordinary kinds when used for the tubes of a Hewitt mercury-vapor
lamp, absorbs a considerable part of the ultra-violet rays
upon which photography chiefly depends. A Jena glass free from
this fault is formed into Uviol lamps of great value in taking
photographs, photo-copying, and photo-engraving. These lamps
are also employed in ascertaining the comparative stability of inks
and artificial dyes; so intense is their action that brief periods
suffice for the tests. Uviol rays severely irritate the eyes and skin;
they may prove useful in treating skin diseases. They moreover
quickly destroy germs. In all these activities reminding us of
radium.</p>

<p>Thus by a bold departure from traditional methods in glass-making,
the eye receives aid from lenses more powerful and more
nearly true than ever before swept the canopy of heaven, or
peered into the structure of minutest life. Meanwhile instruments
of measurement take on a new accuracy and retain it as long as
they last. All this while a material invaluable for its transparency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
is redeemed from brittleness and corrodibility, and given a
strength all but metallic; at the same time transmitting light with
none of the usual subtraction from its beams.</p>

<h3>Power Presses in Metal Working.</h3>

<p>From glass let us now turn to metals. It is their tenacity that
chiefly gives them value; this tenacity is usually accompanied by
a hardness which disposes us to regard nickel,
for example, as of a solidity quite unyielding.
But the coins in our pockets prove that under
the pressure of minting machinery they are as
impressible as wax. In molds and dies, each the counterpart of the
other, brass, bronze, iron, steel, and tin-plate take desired forms
as readily as if paste. Solid
though these metals appear
they yield under severe
stress with a semi-fluid
quality. We have long
had stamped kitchen ware,
baking pans, and the like;
the principle of their manufacture
has of late years
been extended to ware of
more importance. Bliss
power presses are to-day
turning out hundreds of articles which until recently were either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
slowly hammered or spun into form, pieced with solder, or shaped
by the gear cutter or the milling machine. These presses furnish
the United States Navy with sharp-pointed projectiles, some of
them so large as to demand
a million pounds pressure
for their production; they
make strong seamless drawn
bottles, cylindrical tanks for
compressed air and other
gases, and cream separators
able to withstand the bursting tendency of extremely swift
rotation.</p>

<p class="caption">Barrel of pressed steel.</p>
</div>

<p>Presses less powerful produce scores of parts for sewing machines,
typewriters, cash registers, bicycles, and
so on; or, at a blow, strike out a gong from a
disc of bronze. Presses of another kind stamp
out cans in great variety, and even a mandolin
frame in all its irregular curves. Tubs are
quickly pressed from sheets of metal; a pair of
such tubs, tightly joined at their rims by a double
seam, form a barrel impervious to oil or other
liquid, and hence preferable to a wooden barrel. A press operated
by a double crank may be arranged to supersede the forging of
hammers, axes, and mattocks.
Another press at a
blow cuts out the front for
a steel range. Still another
press invades the foundry,
producing excellent gear
wheels for trolley cars, not
weakened by being cut from
a casting across the grain of
the metal. Sometimes the article manufactured requires a series
of operations, as in the case of a kettle cover with its knob. At
the Lalance &amp; Grosjean factory, Woodhaven, New York, a Bliss
press makes such covers in a single continuous round. Another
press treats soft alloys, so that a disc one inch in diameter when
hit by a plunger is forced into the shape of a tube suitable to hold
paint or oil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>In large manufactures as in small the hydraulic forge has
wrought a quiet revolution. If a steel freight car were produced
by planing, turning, slotting and similar machines, it would be
much heavier and dearer
than as turned out to-day
from ingeniously fashioned
dies under severe pressure.
Its girders are molded of
the same strength throughout
with no waste of material,
and without rivets;
corner pieces are avoided;
stiffeners are built up from
the plates themselves
through the introduction of
ridges and depressions: and
in a structure having the fewest possible parts, uniform strength
is attained because dimensions everywhere may freely depart
from uniformity.</p>

<h3>Non-Conductors of Heat.</h3>

<p>In a vast manufactory of steel cars,
of steel structural forms, steam has to
be conveyed long distances from the
boilers. Here, as in similar huge
establishments, or in the heating of
towns and cities from central stations, it is desirable to lose as
little heat as possible by the way, for undue waste means
enormous inroads upon profits. There are
other reasons for wishing to keep heat within
a steam pipe; much damage may be done to
fruit, flour and other merchandise unduly warmed. Furthermore
there is a risk of setting fire to woodwork, paper, cotton and the
like; it has been observed that after a month&#8217;s exposure to heat
from steampipes, wood takes fire at a temperature which at first
would not have led to ignition, because then the wood contained a
little moisture. To guard against loss and danger it has long been
the practice to cover steampipes with jackets of non-conducting
material, such as mineral-wool,&mdash;furnace-slag blown into short
glassy fibres by a sharp blast of air. Felt, loosely folded, also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
serves well. Many advertised claims for asbestos are not well
founded; this mineral is incombustible and is therefore useful in
thick curtains to separate a stage from the auditorium of a
theatre. But it is a fairly good conductor, and for steampipes
should be used as a direct covering of the metal simply to keep an
outer and much thicker coat of felt from being charred. Whatever
the material chiefly employed, one point is clearly brought
out by experiment, namely, that the air detained by the fibres of
a covering greatly aids in obstructing the passage of heat. Hence
it is well to keep the materials from becoming compacted together,
as do ashes when moistened. Asbestos fibres, which are smooth
and glassy, do not take hold of air as do cork and wool.</p>

<p>Professor J. M. Ordway, of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Boston, tells us that non-conductors should be of
materials that are abundant and cheap; clean and inodorous; light
and easy to apply; not liable to become compacted by jarring or
to change by long keeping; not attractive to insects or mice; not
likely to scorch, char or ignite at the long-continued highest temperature
to which they may be exposed; not liable to spontaneous
combustion when partly soaked in oil; not prone to attract
moisture from the air; not capable of exerting chemical action on
the surfaces they touch. No material combines all these desirable
qualities, but a considerable range of substances fulfil
most of the requirements.</p>

<p>Tests of steam-pipe coverings at Sibley College, Cornell University,
and at Michigan University, have resulted as follows<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In general the thickness of the coverings tested was one inch.
Some tests were made with coverings of different thicknesses,
from which it would appear that the gain in insulating power
obtained by increasing the thickness is very slight compared with
the increase in cost.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Some properties of matter seem to have family ties. Tenacity
and conductivity for heat, as an example, go together; all the
tenacious metals as a group are conducting as well. Conversely,
the non-conductors,&mdash;felt, gypsum, and the rest, are structurally
weak. If the inventor could lay hands on a material able to withstand
high pressure and, at the same time, carry off wastefully
but little heat, he would build with it cylinders for steam engines
much more economical than those of to-day He would also give
cooking apparatus of all kinds a covering which would conduce
to the health and comfort of the cook, while, at the same time,
heat would be economized to the utmost. One of the advantages
of electric heat is that it can be readily introduced into kettles
and chafing dishes surrounded by excellent non-conductors; the
result is an efficiency of about ninety-five per cent., quite unapproached
in the operations of a common stove or range.</p>

<h3>Norwegian Cooking Box.</h3>

<p>The costliness of electric heat forbids the housekeeper from
using much of it. Her main source of heat must long continue
to be the common fuels. These, however, thanks to cheap non-conductors,
may be used with much more economy and comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
than of old. Take, for example, the Norwegian cooking box,
steadily gaining favor in Europe and well worthy of popularity
in America. It consists of a box, preferably
cubical, made of closely fitted thick boards,
with a lid which fits tightly. Box and lid are
thickly lined with felt or woolen cloth, and filled with hay except
where pots are placed. These pots, filled with the materials for
a soup, a stew, a ragout, are brought to a boil on a fire and then
placed within the box, its lid being then fastened down. For
two hours or so the cooking process goes on with no further
application of heat. To be sure the temperature has fallen a little,
but it is still high enough to complete the preparation of a wholesome
and palatable dish, with economy of fuel and labor, without
unduly heating the kitchen.</p>

<h3>Aladdin oven.</h3>

<p>On the same principle is the Aladdin oven, invented by the late
Edward Atkinson of Boston, and manufactured by the Aladdin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Oven Company, Brookline, Mass. It is built of iron, surrounded
with air cell asbestos board, so as to maintain a cooking temperature
of 400&deg; Fahr. with little fuel or attention.
Its drop door when open forms a shelf,
when closed it is fastened by a brass eccentric
catch, ensuring tightness; its
wooden stand has an iron
top to hold the oven firmly
in place. This apparatus
cooks a wide range of dishes
admirably, retaining the natural
flavors of meats, fish,
vegetables and fruits as ordinary
excessive temperatures
never do. Mr. Atkinson

<h3>Matter Impressed by Its History.</h3>

<p>Every property of matter
seems universal. The best
non-conductor of heat transmits
a little heat; the best
conductor is by no means perfect: the two classes of substances
are joined by materials which gradually approach one end of the
scale or the other. Nothing is so hard but that
it may be indented or engraved, and where
neither a blow nor severe pressure is employed,
we may have, as in the photographic plate, an
impression which is chemical instead of mechanical, displaying
itself to the eye only when treated with a suitable developer. A
bar of steel hammered on an anvil is changed in properties; as it
becomes closer in texture its tenacity is increased. When that
bar takes its place in a structure, the work it has to do, the shocks
it bears, equally tell upon its fibres. Stresses and strains leave
their effects upon the stoutest machines, engines, bridges; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
are never the same afterward as before, and usually their experience
does them harm. Says an eminent engineer, Mr. W.
Anderson: &#8220;The constant recurrence of stresses, even those within
the elastic limit, causes changes in the arrangement of the particles
which slowly alter their properties. In this way pieces of
machinery, which theoretically were abundantly strong for the
work they had to do, have after a time failed. The effect is intensified
if the stress is suddenly applied, as in the case of armor
plate, or in the wheels of a locomotive. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When considerable
masses of metal have been forged, or severely pressed while
heated, the subsequent cooling of the mass imposes restrictions on
the free movement of some if not all the particles, hence internal
stresses are developed which slowly assert themselves and often
cause unexpected failures. In the manufacture of dies for coinage,
of chilled rollers, of shot and shell hardened in an unequal
manner, spontaneous fractures take place without apparent cause,
through constrained molecular motion of the inner particles
gradually extending the motion of the outer ones until a break
occurs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Benjamin Baker says<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;Many engineers ignore the fact
that a bar of iron may be broken in two ways&mdash;by a single application
of a heavy stress, or by the repeated application of a comparatively
light stress. An athlete&#8217;s muscles have often been
likened to a bar of iron, but if &#8216;fatigue&#8217; be in question, the simile
is very wide of the truth. Intermittent action, the alternative pull
and thrust of the rower, or of the laborer turning a winch, is what
the muscle likes and the bar abhors. A long time ago Braithwaite
correctly attributed the failure of girders, carrying a large
brewery vat, to the vessel being sometimes full and sometimes
empty, the repeated deflection, although imperceptibly slow and
free from vibration, deteriorating the metal, until in the course
of years it broke. These girders were of cast iron, but it was
equally well known that wrought iron was similarly affected, for
Nasmyth afterward called attention to the fact that the alternate
strain in axles rendered them weak and brittle, and suggested annealing
as a remedy, having found that an axle which would snap
with one blow when worn, would bear eighteen blows when new
or just after annealing. We know that the toughest wire can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
be broken if bent backward and forward at a sharp angle; perhaps
only to locomotive and marine engineers does it appear that the
same result will follow in time even when the bending is so slight
as to be unseen by the eye. A locomotive crank-axle bends but
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>34</sub> inch, and a straight driving axle but <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>64</sub>, under the heaviest
bending stresses to which they are exposed, and yet their life is
limited. Experience proves that a very moderate stress alternating
from tension to compression, if repeated about a hundred
million times, will cause fracture as surely as bending to a sharp
angle repeated a few hundred times.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hence an axle, or other structure, should be tested by just such
stresses as it is to withstand in practice. A steel bar may satisfactorily
pass a tensile test applied in one direction, only to break
down disastrously under alternating stresses each less severe.</p>

<h3>Magnetization.</h3>

<p>That matter virtually remembers its impressions is plain when
we study magnetism. Steel when magnetized for the first time
does not behave as when magnetized afterward.
It is as if magnetism at its first onset
threw aside barriers which never again stood
in its way. If the steel is to be brought to its original state it must
be melted and recast, or raised to a white heat for a long time.
In quite other fields of channeled motion we remark that violins
take on a richer sonority with age; their fibres, under the player&#8217;s
hand, seem to fall into such lines as better lend themselves to
musical expression.</p>

<p>In 1878 the late Professor Alfred M. Mayer of the Stevens
Institute of Technology, Hoboken, New Jersey, published a series
of remarkable experiments in the &#8220;American Journal of
Science.&#8221; He there told and pictured how he had magnetized
several small steel needles, thrust through bits of cork set afloat
in water, the south pole of each needle being upward. As the
needles repelled each other, or had their repulsion somewhat overcome
by a large magnet held above them with its north pole
downward, the needles disposed themselves symmetrically in
outlines of great interest, which varied, of course, with the number
of needles afloat at any one time. Three needles formed an
equilateral triangle, four made up a square, five disposed themselves
either as a pentagon or as a square with one magnet at its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
centre, and so on in a series of regular combinations, all suggesting
that magnetic forces may underlie the structure of crystals.</p>

</div>

<h3>The Crystal Foreshadows the Plant.</h3>

<p>One of the remarkable attributes of a crystal is its ability to
grow and act as a unit, as if it had a life of its own, despite the
evident variety and great number of its parts.
Take a crystal of alum, break off a corner and
then immerse the broken mass in its mother
liquor; at once the crystal will repair itself,
new molecules building themselves into its structure as if they
knew where to go. This unity of effect may be observed during
a northern winter on a scale much more striking. In cold
weather on a large sheet of plate glass exposed as a window, a
frost pattern will extend itself as if a tree, beautiful branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
spreading themselves from a main stem which may be seven feet
in height. It is altogether probable that polar forces, such as we
observe in the magnet, are here at work. Their harmony of effect,
in spaces comparatively vast, is astonishing. Forces of allied character
rise to a plane yet higher in vegetation, culminating in the
magnificent sequoia of California, whose life, measured by thousands
of years, goes back almost to the dawn of human civilization.
The union of tools, levers, wheels, as an organized machine;
the co-ordination in research of the parts to be played by observers,
recorders, depicters, generalizers; the regimentation of
soldiers, so that all march, advance and fire as one man under
the control of a single will, is prefigured in the forces which make
a unit of every crystal of saltpetre in a soldier&#8217;s cartridge-box.
Of all the characteristics of matter none is more pervasive
and more marvelous than its ability to form a unit which moves
and acts as if no part were separable from any other, while manifesting
a highly complicated structure, with functions at once
intricate and co-ordinate.</p>

<h3>During Long Periods Minute Influences Become Telling.</h3>

<p>Qualities of matter, much more simple, may now engage our
attention. First, then, let us note how minute influences, acting
for long stretches of time, may change the
qualities of metals and rocks. Forces, too
slight for measurement as yet, are known in
the course of a year or two to affect steel at
times favorably, at other times unfavorably.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
The highest grades of tool-steel are improved by being kept in
stock for a considerable time, the longer the better. It seems
that bayonets, swords, and guns are liable to changes which may
account for failure under sudden thrust or strain. Gauges of
tool steel, which are required to be hard in the extreme, are
finished to their standard sizes a year or two after the hardening
process. Slow molecular changes register themselves in altered
dimensions. In the Bureau of Standards at Washington are a
yard in steel and a yard in brass, at first identical in length; after
twenty years they were found to vary by the <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>5000</sub> of an inch.
Take another case, familiar enough to the railroad engineer: in
a mine, or a tunnel, the roof or wall may tumble down a month
or more after a blasting. The stone which fell immediately upon
the explosion was far from representing all the work done by the
dynamite. A stress was set up in large areas of rock and this at
last, beginning in slight cracks, overcame the cohesion of masses
of huge extent.</p>

<p>Properties undergo change during the simple flight of time: a
parallel diversity is worthy of remark. A substance exhibits
quite diverse qualities according to whether the action upon it is
slow or speedy. A paraffine candle protruding horizontally half
way out of a box, during a New York summer will at last point
directly downward, for all its brittleness. If shoemaker&#8217;s wax is
struck a sudden blow, it breaks into bits as might a pane of window
glass. But place leaden balls on the surface of this same
wax and in the course of ten or twelve weeks you will find them
sunk to the bottom of the mass. When sharply smitten, the wax<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
is rigid and brittle; to a long continued, moderate pressure the
wax proves plastic, semi-fluid almost. All this is repeated when
stone is subjected to severe pressure for as long a period as two
months. At McGill University, Montreal, a small cylinder of
marble thus treated by Professor Frank D. Adams became of
bulging form, without fracture, but with a reduction in tensile
strength of one-half. When the pressure was applied during but
ninety minutes the tensile strength of the resulting mass was but
one-third that presented by the original marble; when the experiment
occupied but ten minutes the tenacity fell to somewhat less
than one-fourth its first degree. These researches shed light on
the stratifications of rocks often folded under extreme pressure
as if rubber or paste.</p>

<p>Take another and quite different example of how variations in
time bring about wide contrasts of result: a rubber ball thrown in
play at a wall rebounds; send it forth from a cannon, with a
hundred-fold this velocity, and it pierces the wall as might a shot
of steel.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
PROPERTIES&mdash;<i>Continued.</i> RADIO-ACTIVITY</h2>

<p class="chaptoc">Properties most evident are studied first .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then those hidden from
cursory view .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Radio-activity revealed by the electrician .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A
property which may be universal and of the highest import .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Its
study brings us near to ultimate explanations .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Faraday&#8217;s prophetic
views.</p>

<p class="chapstart">Properties age after age have become more and more intimately
known. At first the savage took account solely of
the obvious strength of an oak, the sharpness of a flint, the
pliability of a sinew. With the first kindling of fire he discovered
a new round of properties in things long familiar. All kinds of
wood, especially when dry, were found combustible, so were straw
and twigs, as well as the fat of birds, the oil of fish. Then it was
noticed that the ground beneath a fire remained unburnt and grew
firm and hard, so that its clay or mud might be used for rude furnaces
and ovens. Soon come experiments as to the coverings
which maintain coals at red heat, ashes proving the readiest and
best.</p>

<p>A century ago the mastery of electricity began to unfold a new
knowledge of properties, so wide and intimate as to recall the
immense expansion of such knowledge that long before had followed
upon the kindling of fire. The successors of Volta, as
they reproduced his crown of cups, asked, What metals dissolved
in what liquids will give us an electric current at least outlay?
Then followed the further question, What metals drawn into
wire will bear currents afar with least loss? With the invention
of the electro-magnet came another query, What kinds of iron
are most swiftly and largely magnetized by a current; and when
the current ceases, which of them loses its magnetism in the
shortest time? Plainly enough the electrician regards copper,
zinc, iron, steel, acids, alkalis from a new point of view; he discovers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
in them properties which until his advent had been utterly
ignored.</p>

<p>Among the properties of matter revealed by electricity none
are more striking than those displayed in tubes containing highly
rarified gases. The study of their phenomena has led to discoveries
which bring us within view of an ultimate explanation
of properties, an understanding of how matter is atomically built.
All this began simply enough as Plucker, in 1859, sent an electric
discharge through a tube fairly well exhausted, producing
singular bands of color. Geissler, afterward using tubes more
exhausted, produced bands of still higher variegation. In 1875
Professor William Crookes devised the all but vacuous tube
which bears his name, through which he sent electric pulses from
a cathode pole, revealing what he called &#8220;radiant matter,&#8221; as
borne in a beam of cathode rays, as much more tenuous than
ordinary gases as these are more rare than liquids. In 1894
Professor Philipp Lenard observed that cathode rays passed
through a thin plate of aluminium, much as daylight takes its
way through a film of translucent marble. Next year came the
epoch-making discovery of Professor Conrad Wilhelm R&ouml;ntgen
that cathode rays consist in part of X-rays which readily pass
through human flesh, so as to cast shadows of bones upon a
photographic plate. Cathode rays make air a fairly good conductor
of electricity, while ordinary air is non-conducting in an
extreme degree. This singular power is also possessed by the
ultra-violet rays of sunshine, as readily shown by an electroscope.
In 1897 Professor Joseph J. Thomson, of Cambridge University,
demonstrated that cathode rays are made up of corpuscles, or
electrons, about one-thousandth part the size of a hydrogen atom,
and bearing a charge of negative electricity. Such electrons form
a small part of every chemical atom, the remainder of which is,
of course, positively electrified. All electrons are alike, however
various the &#8220;elements&#8221; whence they are derived; as the most
minute masses known to science they may be among the primal
units of all matter.</p>

<p>France, as well as Germany and England, was to take a leading
part in furthering the study of radio-activity. In Paris the famous
Becquerel family had for three generations devoted themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
to studying phosphorescence. Henri Becquerel, third of
the line, said, &#8220;I wonder if a phosphorescent substance, such as
zinc sulphide, would be excited by X-rays.&#8221; He tried the experiment,
causing the sulphide to glow with new vigor. From
that moment proofs have accumulated that the rays of common
phosphorescence such as are emitted by matches, decaying wood
and fish, are of kin to the cathode rays which the electrician
evokes from any substance whatever when he employs a high-tension
current. One day M. Becquerel came upon a remarkable
discovery. He noticed that compounds of uranium, whether
phosphorescent or not, affected a photographic plate through an
opaque covering of black paper, and rendered the adjacent air an
electric conductor. Compounds of thorium, similar to those used
for incandescent mantles, were found to have the same properties.
And here was detected the cause of an annoyance and loss
which had long perplexed photographers. Often they had bestowed
sensitive paper or plates within wrappers of stout paper,
or card, or thick wood, secluded in dark cupboards or drawers.
All in vain. At the end of a few weeks or months these carefully
guarded surfaces were as much discolored as if they had been for
a few minutes exposed, here and there, to daylight itself. All
the while each material relied upon as a safeguard had been
sending forth a feeble but constant beam; treachery had lurked
in the trusted guardian.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of M. Becquerel, M. and Madame Pierre
Curie undertook a thorough quest for these effects in a wide
diversity of substances. They found that several minerals containing
uranium were more radio-active than that element itself.
Pitchblende, for instance, consisting mainly of an oxide of uranium,
was especially energetic as it approached an electroscope,
suggesting the presence of an uncommonly active constituent,
thus far not identified. At the end of a most laborious series of
separations they came at last to a minute quantity of radium
chloride displaying extraordinary properties. Another compound
of radium, a bromide, has since been arrived at: radium by itself
has not yet been obtained. In radio-activity radium chloride surpasses
uranium about one-million-fold. Provided with an electroscope
of exquisite sensibility, Professor Ernest Rutherford of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
McGill University, Montreal, has discovered seven distinct radiations
from radium, each with characteristics of its own. Directed
upon plates of aluminium he finds its <i>gamma</i> rays to be 100
times more penetrating than its <i>beta</i> rays, and <i>beta</i> rays 100
times more penetrating than its <i>alpha</i> rays. Each radiation has
qualities as distinct as those of an ordinary chemical element.
<i>Beta</i> rays behave in all respects like cathode rays, so that here a
bridge is discerned betwixt the qualities of radium and the long
familiar phenomena of the Crookes tube.</p>

<p>The substance ranking next in radio-activity to radium is
thorium. Professor Rutherford has observed it throwing off a
substance he calls Thorium X; this radiates strongly for a time,
the parent mass not radiating at all. Gradually Thorium X
ceases to radiate and the original thorium resumes an emission
of Thorium X. From Thorium X emanates what seems a gas,
condensible by extreme cold, which attaches itself to adjacent
bodies so as to make them radio-active. This emanation in its
turn produces successively three new and distinct kinds of radiation.
Professor Charles Baskerville, of the College of the City
of New York, has separated from thorium two substances probably
elementary, carolinium and berzelium.</p>

<p>Other radio-active substances have each several derivatives:
actinium has nine, uranium has four. As researchers broaden
their range of inquiry they steadily lengthen the list of radio-active
substances. Minerals of many kinds, water from springs,
especially those of medicinal value, the leaves of plants, newly
fallen snow, and even common air, are found to be radio-active,
although usually in but a slight degree, so that the doubt may be
expressed, Is the observed effect due to a trace of some highly
radio-active material diffused in something else which is not
radio-active at all? Should it be established that radio-activity
is really present in all matter it would be no other than a parallel
to what, at another point in the physical scale, presents itself as
ordinary evaporation.</p>

<h3>Solids are not as Solid as They Seem.</h3>

<p>In a northern winter we may observe in air almost still, the
wasting away of a large block of ice, so that during a week it
loses a considerable part of its bulk. The giving forth of vapor
is evidently not restricted to high or to ordinary temperatures, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
may occur below the freezing point of water. In 1863, Thomas
Graham, the eminent Scottish physicist, from many experiments
with metals expressed the opinion that what
seems to be a solid may be also in a minute
degree both liquid and gaseous as well. Confirmation
of this view was afforded in 1886
by Professor W. Spring, of Liege, who formed alloys by strongly
compressing their constituents as powders at ordinary temperatures.
It is probable that a slight pervasive liquidity gave success
to the experiment. Professor Roberts-Austen once observed
that an electric-deposit of iron on a clean copper plate adhered so
firmly that when they were severed by force, a film was stripped
from the copper plate and remained on the iron, signifying that
the two metals had penetrated each other at an ordinary temperature.
This interpenetration he found to take place through films
of electro-deposited nickel. In a remarkable round of experiments
he also found that at 100&deg; C., a temperature much below
the fusing point of lead, gold as leaf is slightly diffused through
a mass of lead; when the lead is fluid at 550&deg; C., the proportion
of diffused gold is increased 160,000 times. This volatility of the
particles of a heavy metal shows us plainly that virtual evaporation
may be always taking place from metallic surfaces at ordinary
temperatures,&mdash;a phenomenon which may be the same in
kind as the pouring out of a perceptible stream of corpuscles under
strong electrical excitation. The analogy goes further, at
least in the case of liquids, which exhale a vapor usually different
in composition from the parent body; take, for example, a solution
of sugar in water which sends forth watery vapor only, or
observe a mixture of much water and a little alcohol as it emits
a vapor largely alcoholic and but slightly aqueous.</p>

<h3>Every Property May be Universal.</h3>

<p>Here we are reminded of a striking experiment by Faraday:
exciting an electro-magnet of gigantic proportions he showed
that every substance he brought near to it was
affected in a definite degree. He found iron to
be pre-eminently magnetic, much as Madame
Curie has shown radium to be vastly more
radio-active than any other substance. From Faraday&#8217;s time to
the present hour the whole trend of investigation has built up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
probability that every known property in some degree exists in all
matter whatever. Copper conducts electricity remarkably well,
and gutta percha conducts remarkably ill; but gutta percha has
some little conductivity, or thinner sheets of it than those now used
would suffice to keep within an ocean cable the throbs which pass
between America and Europe. In radio-activity many substances
may be as low in the scale as is gutta percha in the list of electric
conductors; in that case no existing means of detection would
make the property manifest.</p>

<h3>Radium Reveals Properties Unknown Till Now.</h3>

<p>While radio-activity may be a universal property of matter, to
be disclosed more and more as means of detection are refined and
improved, radium compounds are to-day in a
class quite by themselves. Radium bromide
constantly maintains itself at a temperature of
3&deg; to 5&deg; C. higher than that of its surroundings,
so that every hour it could boil its own weight of water. Professor
Rutherford estimates the life of radium as 1,800 years, its
emanations in breaking up through their successive stages emitting
about three million times as much energy as is given out by the
union of an equal volume of hydrogen and oxygen, mixed in the
proportions which form water, a union accompanied by more heat
than that evolved in any other chemical change. Whence this
amazing stream of energy? It is probable that each radium atom
may break into minute parts, or corpuscles, which, moving at a
velocity of 120,000 miles a second or so, collide so as to cause the
observed heat.</p>

<p>From another side the compounds of radium bid us revise the
laws of chemical change as taught up to the close of the nineteenth
century. In the pores of many radio-active minerals may be found
that remarkable element, helium, first detected in the sun by
means of the spectroscope, then afterward discovered in the pores
of cleveite, a mineral unearthed in Norway. Sir William Ramsay
and Mr. Frederick Soddy have found helium in the gases evolved
from radium chloride kept as a solid for some months. The spectrum
of helium was at first invisible; it soon appeared and steadily
grew more intense with the lapse of time. &#8220;It appears not unlikely,&#8221;
says Professor Rutherford, &#8220;that many of the so-called
chemical elements may prove to be compounds of helium, or, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
other words, that the helium atom is one of the secondary units
with which the heavier atoms are built up.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a

<p>Already the phenomena of radio-activity, although of puzzling
intricacy, have greatly broadened our conceptions of matter.
Where we were wont to deem it of simple structure, it displays a
baffling complexity, as indeed has long been suggested in so highly
diversified a spectrum as that of iron. We find that radiations
from an &#8220;element&#8221; may consist not only in the undulations of an
ether, but also in an emission of matter as real as the projection
of steam from a boiling pot. Newton believed sunshine to be a
stream of corpuscles: he was wrong with respect to sunlight, his
conception is true of many other kinds of radiation. Until quite
lately we looked upon atoms as indivisible bodies; to-day we have
learned that at least some of them may on occasion divide into
many parts, each part moving with a speed approaching that of
light, with energy far exceeding that of any chemical action we
know. In the field of ray-transmission our knowledge has undergone
a like gain in width. Twenty years ago we spoke of the
opacity of lead, the transparency of flint glass, as absolute properties.
To-day we learn that given its accordant ray any substance
whatever affords that ray free passage, as when oak an inch thick
transmits pulses from radium. Yet more: ordinary chemical
changes require us to bring one substance into contact with another;
usually we must also apply heat or electricity to the bodies
thus joined; they are always responsive to changes of temperature.
Within the past six years we have become acquainted with changes
incomparably more energetic than those of the most violent chemical
action; many of them proceed with apparent spontaneity from
a substance all by itself. In the case of radium neither extreme
cold nor extreme heat has any perceptible effect upon the radiant
stream.</p>

<p>One of the results of investigation in radio-activity is that it
shows the alchemists in their attempts at transmutation to have
stood on solid ground. Says Professor Rutherford: &#8220;There can
be no doubt that in the radio-elements we are witnessing the spontaneous
transformation of matter, and that the different products<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
which arise mark the stages or halting places in the process of
transformation, where the atoms are able to exist for a short time
before breaking up into new systems.&#8221;</p>

<h3>History of the Universe Rewritten in the Light of Radio-Activity.</h3>

<p>Radio-activity has a vivid interest far beyond the laboratories of
chemists and physicians. One of the long standing puzzles of
geology has been to explain why the temperature
of the earth has remained fairly constant
ever since organic life made its appearance. A
sister problem has been the maintenance by the
sun of its vast output of heat and light, age
after age, with little or no diminution of intensity. Professor
Rutherford and Mr. Soddy believe that the phenomena of radio-activity
may solve both these problems: an element like helium
may furnish a store of energy vastly greater than that of ordinary
chemical action, and much lengthen the cooling process due to
radiation from either the sun or the earth.</p>

<p>Radio-activity, furthermore, throws new light upon evolution
regarded in its broadest aspects. The corpuscles discovered in
1897 by Professor J. J. Thomson, as he severed atoms in pieces,
are all alike whatever chemical element may be the parent body.
Hence it is argued that we may have here the primal units of all
matter whatever. Sir Norman Lockyer long ago pointed out that
helium and hydrogen predominate in the hottest stars, while in
stars less hot more complex types of matter appear. He argues
that these stars as they successively lose heat show a development
of what chemists call elements. His views are parallel with the
suggestion that in the radio-active corpuscle we make acquaintance
with an ultimate element of all matter, whether observed in a
laboratory tube or in the squadrons bright of the midnight
heavens.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

Radio-activity and other physical phenomena recently discovered are
set forth in &#8220;The New Knowledge,&#8221; by Professor Robert Kennedy Duncan,
published by A. S. Barnes &amp; Co., New York, 1905; and &#8220;The Recent
Development of Physical Science,&#8221; by W. C. D. Whetham, published by
John Murray, London, and P. Blakiston, Son &amp; Co., Phila., 1906.</p></div>

<p>The phenomena of radio-activity revive interest in the prophetic
views of Michael Faraday. In 1816, when he was but twenty-four
years of age, he delivered a lecture at the Royal Institution in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
London on Radiant Matter. In the course of his remarks there
occurs this passage<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<h3>Faraday&#8217;s Prophetic Views.</h3>

<p>&#8220;If we now conceive a change as far beyond vaporization as
that is above fluidity, and then take into account the proportional
increased extent of alteration as the changes
arise, we shall perhaps, if we can form any
conception at all, not fall short of radiant
matter; and as in the last conversion many
qualities were lost, so here also many more would disappear.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the opinion of Newton, and of many other distinguished
philosophers, that this conversion was possible, and continually
going on in the processes of nature, and they found that the idea
would bear without injury the applications of mathematical reasoning&mdash;as
regards heat, for instance. If assumed, we must also
assume the simplicity of matter; for it would follow that all the
variety of substances with which we are acquainted could be converted
into one of three kinds of radiant matter, which again may
differ from each other only in the size of their particles or their
form. The properties of known bodies would then be supposed
to arise from the varied arrangements of their ultimate atoms, and
belong to substances only as long as their compound nature
existed; and thus variety of matter and variety of properties
would be found co-essential.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

&#8220;Life and Letters of Faraday,&#8221; by Bence Jones. Vol. I, p. 216.</p></div>

<p>Three years later he returned to this theme in another
lecture<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;By the power of heat all solid bodies have been fused into
fluids, and there are very few the conversion of which into
gaseous forms is at all doubtful. In inverting the method, attempts
have not been so successful. Many gases refuse to resign
their form, and some fluids have not been frozen. If, however,
we adopt means which depend on the rearrangement of particles,
then these refractory instances disappear, and by combining substances
together we can make them take the solid, fluid, or
gaseous form at pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;In these observations on the changes of state, I have purposely
avoided mentioning the radiant state of matter, being purely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
hypothetical, it would not have been just to the demonstrated
parts of the science to weaken the force of their laws by connecting
them with what is undecided. I may now, however,
notice a progression in physical properties accompanying
changes of form, and which is perhaps sufficient to induce, in
the inventive and sanguine philosopher, a considerable belief in
the association of the radiant form with the others in the set
of changes I have mentioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;As we ascend from the solid to the fluid and gaseous states,
physical properties diminish in number and variety, each state
having some of those which belong to the preceding state. When
solids are converted into fluids, all varieties of hardness and softness
are necessarily lost. Crystalline and other shapes are destroyed.
Opacity and color frequently give way to a colorless
transparency, and a general mobility of particles is conferred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Passing onward to the gaseous state, still more of the evident
characters of bodies are annihilated. The immense differences
in their weights almost disappear; the remains of difference in
color that were left, are lost. Transparency becomes universal,
and they are all elastic. They now form but one set of substances,
and the varieties of density, hardness, opacity, color,
elasticity and form, which render the number of solids and fluids
almost infinite, are now supplied by a few slight variations in
weight, and some unimportant shades of color.</p>

<p>&#8220;To those, therefore, who admit the radiant form of matter,
no difficulty exists in the simplicity of the properties it possesses,
but rather an argument in their favor. These persons show you
a gradual resignation of properties in the matter we can appreciate
as the matter ascends in the scale of forms, and they would
be surprised if that effect were to cease at the gaseous state. They
point out the greater exertions which nature makes at each step
of the change, and think that, consistently, it ought to be greatest
at the passage from the gaseous to the radiant form.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a

<p>This remarkable deliverance recalls what another great experimental
philosopher, Count Rumford, deduced as by dint of
mechanical motion he melted ice in a closed and insulated receiver.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
He inferred that the heat thus generated was not a
material substance, as then generally supposed, but must be in
essence motion, for only motion had brought it into existence.
As we follow Faraday&#8217;s recital of the successive changes in properties
which follow upon additions of heat, in other words, of
mechanical motion, the inference is irresistible that properties
consist in the distinct motions of masses of definite form and
size, these very motions, perhaps, deciding both the form and
size of each mass.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />
MEASUREMENT</h2>

<p class="chaptoc">Methods beginning in rule-of-thumb proceed to the utmost refinement .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
foot and cubit .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The metric system .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Refined measurement a
means of discovery .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The interferometer measures 1-5,000,000 inch .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A

<p class="chapstart">A child notices that his bedroom is smaller than the family
parlor, that to-day is warmer than yesterday was, that iron
is much heavier than wood and less easily marked by a blow.
The child becomes a well grown boy before he paces the length
and breadth of rooms so as to compare their areas and add to his
mensuration lesson an example from home. If instead of pacing
he were to use a foot-rule, or a tape-line, so much the better.
About this time he may begin to observe the thermometer, noting
that within five hours, let us say, it has fallen eight degrees. As
a child he took account of bigness or smallness, lightness or
heaviness, warmth or cold; now he passes to measuring their
amount. In so doing he spans in a few years what has required
for mankind ages of history. When corn and peltries are bartered,
or axes and calumets are bought and sold, a shrewd guess
at sizes and weights is enough for the parties to the bargain. But
when gold or gems change owners a balance of delicacy must be
set up, and the moral code resounds with imprecations on all who
tamper with its weights or beam. Perhaps the balance was suggested
by the children&#8217;s teeter, that primitive means of sport
which crosses one prone tree with another, playmates rising and
falling at the ends of the upper, moving trunk. In essence the
most refined balance of to-day is a teeter still. Its successive
improvements register the transition from merely considering
what a thing is, whether stone, wood, oil or what not, to ascertaining
just how much there is of it; or, in formal phrase, to
make and use an accurate balance means passing from the qualitative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
to the quantitative stage of inquiry. Before Lavoisier&#8217;s
day it was thought that any part of a substance which disappeared
in burning was annihilated. Lavoisier carefully gathered all the
products of combustion, and with scales of precision showed that
they weighed just as much as the elements before they were
burned. He thus laid the corner-stone of modern chemistry by
demonstrating that matter is invariable in its total quantity, notwithstanding
all chemical unions or partings. Phases of energy
other than gravity are now measured with instruments as much
improved of late years as the balance; they tell us the great truth
that energy like matter is constant in quantity, however much it
may vary from form to form, however many the subtle and
elusive disguises it may wear.</p>

<h3>Foot and Cubit.</h3>

<p>How the foot, our commonest measure, has descended to us is
an interesting story. The oldest known standard of length, the
cubit, was the distance between the point of a
man&#8217;s elbow and the tip of his middle finger.
In Egypt the ordinary cubit was 18.24 inches,
and the royal cubit, 20.67 inches. A royal cubit in hard wood,
perfectly preserved, was discovered among the ruins of Memphis
early in the nineteenth century. It bears the date of the reign
of Horus, who is believed to have become King of Egypt about
1657 B. C. The Greeks adopted a foot, equal to two-thirds of the
ordinary Egyptian cubit, as their standard of length. This measure,
12.16 inches, was introduced into Italy, where it was divided
into twelfths or inches according to the Roman duodecimal system,
thence to find its way throughout Europe.</p>

<p>Units equally important with the cubit were from of old
derived from the finger and the fingers joined. The breadth of
the forefinger at the middle part of its first joint became the
<i>digit</i>; four digits were taken as a <i>palm</i>, or hand-breadth, used to
this day in measuring horses. Another ancient unit, not yet obsolete,
the <i>pace</i>, is forty digits; while the <i>fathom</i>, still employed,
is ninety-six digits, as spaced by the extended arms from the
finger tips. The cubit is twenty-four digits, and the foot is sixteen
digits. Thus centuries ago were laid the foundations of the
measurement of space as an art. A definite part of the human
body was adopted as a standard of length, and copied on rods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
of wood and slabs of stone. Divisors and multiples, in whole
numbers, were derived from that standard for convenience in
measuring lines comparatively long or short. And yet in practice,
even as late as a century ago, much remained faulty. Standards
varied from nation to nation, and from district to district.
Carelessness in copying yard-measures, the wear and tear suffered
by lengths of wood or metal, the neglect to take into account
perturbing effects of varying temperatures on the materials
employed, all constrained men of science to seek a standard of
measurement upon which the civilized world could unite, and
which might be safeguarded against inaccuracy.</p>

<h3>The Metric System.</h3>

<p>Here the Government of France took the lead; in 1791 it appointed
as a committee Lagrange, Laplace, Borda, Monge, and
Condorcet, five illustrious members of the
French Academy, to choose a natural constant
from which a unit of measurement might be
derived, that constant to serve for comparison or reference at
need. They chose the world itself to yield the unit sought, and
set on foot an expedition to ascertain the length of a quadrant,
or quarter-circle of the earth, from the equator to the north pole,
taking an arc of the meridian from Dunkirk to Barcelona, nearly
nine and one-half degrees, as part of the required curve. When
the quadrant had been measured, with absolute precision, as it
was believed, its ten-millionth part, the <i>metre</i>, was adopted as
the new standard of length. As the science and art of measurement
have since advanced, it has been found that the measured
quadrant is about 1472.5 metres longer than as reported in 1799
by the commissioners. Furthermore, the form of the earth is
now known to be by no means the same when one quadrant is
compared with another; and even a specific quadrant may vary
from age to age both in contour and length as the planet shrinks
in cooling, becomes abraded by wind and rain, rises or falls with
earthquakes, or bends under mountains of ice and snow in its
polar zones. All this has led to the judicious conclusion that there
is no advantage in adopting a quadrant instead of a conventional
unit, such as a particular rod of metal, preserved as a standard
for comparison in the custody of authorities national or international.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>What gives the metric system pre-eminence is the simplicity
and uniformity of its decimal scale, forming part and parcel as
it does of the decimal system of notation, and lending itself to a
decimal coinage as in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. The
metre is organically related to all measures of length, surface,
capacity, solidity, and weight. A cubic centimetre of water,
taken as it melts in a vacuum, at 4&deg; C., the temperature of maximum
density, is the <i>gram</i> from which other weights are derived;
this <i>gram</i> of water becomes a measure of capacity, the millilitre,
duly linked with other similar measures. Surfaces are measured
in square metres, solids in cubic metres. Simple prefixes are:
deci-, one-tenth; centi-, one-hundredth; milli-, one-thousandth;
deka-, multiplies a unit by ten; hecto-, by one hundred;
kilo-, by one thousand; and myria-, by ten thousand.</p>

<p>As long ago as 1660 Mouton, a Jesuit teacher of Lyons, proposed
a metric system which should be unalterable because derived
from the globe itself. Watt, the great improver of the
steam engine, in a letter of November 14th, 1783, suggested a
metric system in all respects such as the French commissioners
eight years later decided to adopt.</p>

<p>The nautical mile of 2029 yards has the honor of being the
first standard based upon the dimensions of the globe. It was
supposed to measure one-sixtieth part of a degree on the equator;
the supposition was somewhat in error.</p>

<h3>Uses of Refined Measurement.</h3>

<p>Lord Kelvin, a master in the art of measurement, an inventor
of electrical measuring instruments of the highest precision, as
president of the British Association for the
Advancement of Science in 1871, said: &#8220;Accurate
and minute measurement seems to the
non-scientific imagination, a less lofty and
dignified work than looking for something new. But nearly all
the grandest discoveries of science have been but the rewards of
accurate measurement and patient, long-continued labor in the
minute sifting of numerical results. The popular idea of Newton&#8217;s
grand discovery is that the theory of gravitation flashed
upon his mind, and so the discovery was made. It was by a long
train of mathematical calculation, founded on results accumulated
through prodigious toil of practical astronomers, that Newton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
first demonstrated the forces urging the planets towards the
sun, determined the magnitude of those forces, and discovered
that a force following the same law of variation with distance
urges the moon towards the earth. Then first, we may suppose,
came to him the idea of the <i>universality of gravitation</i>; but when
he attempted to compare the magnitude of the force on the moon
with the magnitude of the force of gravitation of a heavy body
of equal mass at the earth&#8217;s surface, he did not find the agreement
which the law he was discovering required. Not for years after
would he publish his discovery as made. It is recounted that,
being present at a meeting of the Royal Society, he heard a
paper read, describing a geodesic measurement by Picard, which
led to a serious correction of the previously accepted estimate of
the earth&#8217;s radius. This was what Newton required; he went
home with the result, and commenced his calculations, but felt
so much agitated that he handed over the arithmetical work to a
friend; then (and not when sitting in a garden he saw an apple
fall) did he ascertain that gravitation keeps the moon in her orbit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Faraday&#8217;s discovery of specific inductive capacity, which inaugurated
the new philosophy, tending to discard action at a distance,
was the result of minute and accurate measurement of
electric forces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joule&#8217;s discovery of a thermo-dynamic law, through the
regions of electro-chemistry, electro-magnetism, and elasticity of
gases was based on a delicacy of thermometry which seemed impossible
to some of the most distinguished chemists of the day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Andrews&#8217; discovery of the continuity between the gaseous
and the liquid states was worked out by many years of laborious
and minute measurement of phenomena scarcely sensible to the
naked eye.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Further Refinements Needed.</h3>

<p>It is with these examples before them that investigators take
the trouble to weigh a mass in a vacuum, to watch the index of
a balance through a telescope at a distance of
twelve feet, or use an interferometer to space
out an inch into a million parts. Their one
desire is to arrive at truth as nearly as they
can, to bring grounds of disagreement to the vanishing point,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
and ensure exactness in all the computations based on their
work. As art advances from plane to plane it demands new
niceties of measurement, discovers sources of error unsuspected
before, and avoids these errors by ingenious precautions. To-day
observers earnestly wish for means of measurement surpassing
those at hand. Take the astronomer for example. One
would suppose that the two points of the earth&#8217;s orbit which are
farthest apart, divided as they are by about 185,000,000 miles,
would afford sufficient room between them for a base-line wherewith
to measure celestial spaces. But the fact is otherwise. So
remote are the fixed stars that nearly all of them seem unchanged
in place whether we observe them on January 3 or July 3, although
meanwhile we have changed our point of view by the
whole length of the ellipse described by the earth in its motion.</p>

<p>Then, too, the chemist is now concerned with analyses of a
delicacy out of the question a century ago. His reward is in discovering
the great influence wrought by admixtures so slight in
amount as almost to defy quantitative recognition. In the experiments
by M. Guillaume, elsewhere recited, his unit throughout
every research was one-thousandth of a millimetre, or
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>25,400</sub> inch. Argon, a gas about one-fourth heavier than
oxygen, forms nearly one-hundredth part of the atmosphere, and
yet its discovery by Lord Rayleigh dates only from 1894. His
feat depended not only upon refined modes of measurement, but
also upon his challenging the traditional analyses of common air.
The utmost resources of refrigeration, of spectroscopy, and of
measurement were required to detect four elements associated in
minute quantities with argon, and of like chemical inertness.
These are helium, having a density of 1.98 as compared with 16
for oxygen; neon, of 9.96 density; krypton, of 40.78; and xenon,
of 64. Argon itself has a density of 19.96. &#8220;Air contains,&#8221; says
Sir William Ramsay, &#8220;one or two parts of neon per 100,000, one
or two parts of helium per 1,000,000, about one part of krypton
per 1,000,000, and about one part of xenon per 20,000,000; these
together with argon form no less than 0.937 per cent. of the atmosphere.
As a group these elements occupy a place between the
strongly electro-negative elements of the fluorine group, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
very positive electro-positive elements of the lithium group. By
virtue of their lack of electric polarity and their inactivity they
form, in a certain sense, a connecting link between the two.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_25"

<h3>Precise Measurement as a Means of Discovery.</h3>

<p>As measurements become more and more precise they afford
an important means of discovery. Sir William Crookes tells
us<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;It is well known that of late years new
elementary bodies, new interesting compounds
have often been discovered in residual products,
in slags, flue-dusts, and waste of various
kinds. In like manner, if we carefully scrutinize the processes
either of the laboratory or of nature, we may occasionally detect
some slight anomaly, some unanticipated phenomenon which we
cannot account for, and which, were received theories correct and
sufficient, ought not to occur. Such residual phenomena are
hints which may lead the man of disciplined mind and of finished
manipulative skill to the discovery of new elements, of new
laws, possibly even of new forces; upon undrilled men these possibilities
are simply thrown away. The untrained physicist or
chemist fails to catch these suggestive glimpses. If they appear
under his hands, he ignores them as the miners of old did the
ores of cobalt and nickel.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>It was a residual effect which led to the discovery of the planet
Neptune. The orbit of Uranus being exactly defined, it was noticed
by Adams and Leverrier that after making due allowance for perturbations
by all known bodies, there remained a small disturbance
which they believed could be accounted for only by the existence
of a planet as yet unobserved. That planet was forthwith sought,
and soon afterward discovered, proving in mass and path to be
capable of just the effect which had required explanation.</p>

<h3>Measurements Refined: the Interferometer.</h3>

<p>In the measurement of length or motion a most refined instrument
is the interferometer, devised by Professor A. A. Michelson,
of the University of Chicago. It enables
an observer to detect a movement through one
five-millionth of an inch. The principle involved
is illustrated in a simple experiment. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
by dropping a pebble at each of two centres, say a yard apart, in
a still pond, we send out two systems of waves, each system will
ripple out in a series of concentric circles. If, when the waves
meet, the crests from one set of waves coincide with the depressions
from the other set, the water in that particular spot becomes
smooth because one set of waves destroys the other. In this
case we may say that the waves interfere. If, on the other hand,
the crests of waves from two sources should coincide, they would
rise to twice their original height. Light-waves sent out in a
similar mode from two points may in like manner either interfere,
and produce darkness, or unite to produce light of double
brilliancy. These alternate dark and bright bands are called interference
fringes. When one of the two sources of light is
moved through a very small space, the interference fringes at a
distance move through a space so much larger as to be easily observed
and measured, enabling an observer to compute the short
path through which a light-source has moved. In the simplest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
form of <a href="#Fig175">interferometer</a>, light from any chosen source, S, is rendered
approximately parallel in its rays by a double convex lens
at L. The light falling upon the glass plate A is divided into two
beams, one of which passes to the mirror M, while the other is
reflected to M&sup1;. The rays reflected from M&sup1;, which pass through
A, and those returned from M reflected at d, are reunited, and
may be observed at E. In order to produce optical symmetry of
the two luminous paths, a plate C exactly like A is introduced
between A and M. When the distance from d to M and to M&sup1;
are the same the observer sees with white light a central black
spot surrounded with colored rings. When the mirror M&sup1; is
moved parallel to itself either further from or nearer to A, the
fringes of interference move across the field of view at E. A
displacement of one fringe corresponds to a movement of half a
wave-length of light by the mirror M&sup1;. By counting the number
of fringes corresponding to a motion of M&sup1; we are able to express
the displacement in terms of a wave-length of light. Where by
other means this distance is measurable, the length of the light-wave
may be deduced. With intense light from a mercury tube
790,000 fringes have been counted, amounting to a difference in
path of about one-fourth of a metre.</p>

<div class="figc300" id="Fig176">
<img src="images/illo260.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="278" />
<p class="caption">Light-wave distorted in
passing through
heated air.</p>
</div>

<p>Many diverse applications of the interferometer have been developed,
as, for example, in thermometry. The warmth of a
hand held near a pencil of light is enough to cause a wavering of
the fringes. A lighted match shows <a href="#Fig176">contortions</a> as here illustrated.
When the air is heated its
density and refractive power diminish:
it follows that if this experiment is
tried under conditions which show a
regular and measurable displacement of
the fringes, their movement will indicate
the temperature of the air. This
method has been applied to ascertain
very high temperatures, such as those
of the blast furnace. Most metals expand
one or two parts in 100,000 for a rise in temperature of one
degree centigrade. When a small specimen is examined the
whole change to be measured may be only about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10,000</sub>
inch, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
space requiring a good microscope to perceive, but readily measured
by an interferometer. It means a displacement amounting to
several fringes, and this may be measured to within <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>50</sub> of a
fringe or less; so that the whole displacement may be measured
to within a fraction of one per cent. Of course, with long bars
the accuracy attainable is much greater.</p>

<h3>Application to Weighing.</h3>

<p>The interferometer has much refined the indications of the
balance. In a noteworthy experiment Professor Michelson found
the amount of attraction which a sphere of lead
exerted on a small sphere hung on an arm of
a delicate balance. The amount of this attraction
when two such spheres touch is proportional to the diameter
of the large sphere, which in this case was about eight inches.
The attraction on the small ball on the end of the balance was
thus the same fraction of its weight as the diameter of the large
ball was of the diameter of the earth,&mdash;something like one
twenty-millionth. So the force to be measured was one twenty-millionth
of the weight of this small ball. In the interferometer
the approach of the small ball to the large one produced a displacement
of seven whole fringes.</p>

<p>In order that this instrument may yield the best results, great
care must be exercised in its construction. The runways of the
frame are straightened with exactitude by a method due to Mr.
F. L. O. Wadsworth. The optical surfaces of the planes and
mirrors in the original designs were from the master hand of
Mr. John A. Brashear of Allegheny, Pennsylvania. Each mirror
is free from any irregularity greater than <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>880,000</sub> inch, and
the opposite faces of the mirrors must be parallel within one second
of arc, or <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>1,296,000</sub> part of a circle.<a name="FNanchor_27"

Gaertner &amp; Co., 5347 Lake Avenue, Chicago.</p></div>

<h3>A Light-Wave as an Unvarying Unit of Length.</h3>

<p>Now for a word as to Professor Michelson&#8217;s suggestion that
an unvarying unit of measurement may be found in a certain
light-wave, as observed in the interferometer.
Everybody knows that each chemical element
burns with colors of its own. When we see red
fire bursting from a rocket we know that
strontium is ablaze; when the tint is green it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
tells us that copper is on fire, as when a trolley-wheel jumps
from its electric wire. When these sources of light are looked at
through an accurate prism of glass in a spectroscope they form
characteristic spectra, and these spectra in their peculiarities of
color reveal what elements are aflame. In most cases the rays
from an element form a highly complicated series; to this rule
cadmium, a metal resembling zinc, is an exception. It emits a
red, a green, and a blue ray; the wave-lengths of these rays Professor
Michelson proposes as a basis of reference for the metallic
standards of length adopted by the nations of Europe and America.
He says: &#8220;We have in the interferometer a means of comparing
the fundamental standard of length with a natural unit&mdash;the
length of a light-wave&mdash;with about the same order of accuracy
as is at present possible in the comparison of two metre-bars,
that is, to one part in twenty millions. The unit depends on
the properties of the vibrating atoms of the radiating substance,
and of the luminiferous ether, and is probably one of the least
changeable qualities in the material universe. If therefore the
metre and all its copies were destroyed, they could be replaced by
new ones, which would not differ among themselves. While such
a simultaneous disaster is practically impossible, it is by no
means sure that notwithstanding the elaborate precautions that
have been taken to ensure permanency, there may not be slow
molecular changes going on in all the standards, changes which
it would be impossible to detect except by some such method as
that here presented.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus, by dint of mechanical refinements such as the world never
saw before, some of the smallest units revealed to the eye become
the basis of all measurement whatever, reaching at last those
cosmical diameters across which light itself is the sole messenger.
In the early days of spectroscopy many doubters said, What
good is all this? Since then a full reply has been rendered to
their question and, at this unexpected point, the spectroscopic
examination of an unimportant metal may afford a measuring
unit of ideal stability. Cases like this suggest the query, Is any
knowledge whatever quite worthless?</p>

<h3>The Balance in Measurement.</h3>

<p class="chapstart">Our grandfathers supposed that trade began in barter; we
have been able to go one step further back in history to
find that barter followed upon the custom of exchanging presents.
This custom, among shrewd and self-respecting people, came at
length to a degree of fairness, and led to rough
and ready modes of weighing, gradually improved.
In the British Museum, in a papyrus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of Hunnafer, who lived in Egypt thirty-three centuries ago, we
have pictured a well-constructed balance of equal arms, in which
a feather is outweighing a human soul. In its successive improvements
the balance registers the progress of many arts and
sciences, and in its turn has promoted them all. It must be built
of a metal, or an alloy, hard, durable, and not easily corroded.
Its centre of motion should be a little above its centre of gravity;
its knife edge should have an angle of about 60 degrees. Appliances
must render it easy to lift the weighing apparatus when
out of use, so that unnecessary wear of the knife edge may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
avoided, as well as needless strain throughout the structure. Air
currents should be kept off by a suitable case, or, better still, the
instrument should be enclosed in a receiver exhausted of air altogether.
The weights, made with scrupulous care of standard
metal or alloy, should be guarded from tampering, abrasion, and
corrosion, from dirt or other accretions. A weighing should be
slowly performed, the weights placed in the center of one pan,
the object weighed in the center of the other pan; to eliminate
errors due to inequality in the length of arms, the article weighed
and the weights are then made to exchange places. The platform
should be of the utmost strength and rigidity, so as precisely to
maintain its level at all times.</p>

<div class="figc450" id="Fig178">
<img src="images/illo264.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="511" />
<p class="caption">A Rueprecht balance.</p>
</div>

<p>As long ago as 1798 a balance was erected having an accuracy
of one part in 1,600,000; fifty years later ten-fold greater accuracy
had been attained; to-day results much more astonishing are
achieved. A <a href="#Fig178">precision balance</a> manufactured by Messrs. Albert
Rueprecht &amp; Son, Vienna, is shown on page 220, as furnished
in 1902 to the International Bureau of Weights and Measures at
Sevres, France. It is provided with means for applying the
smallest weights of platinum from a distance of three to four
metres, so as to guard against perturbations due to the warmth
of an operator&#8217;s body. The weights may be shifted from one
pan to the other, and the oscillations observed through a telescope,
at a distance of four metres. This balance will detect the
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>500</sub> of a milligram when weighing a mass of 500 grams, or one
part in 250,000,000. Such balances, and those of Paul Bunge, of
Hamburg, require ten to twenty months of skilled labor for their
completion. The International Bureau of Weights and Measures
has a balance of extraordinary sensitiveness at the Pavillon de
Breteuil, Sevres, where the work of the Bureau goes forward.
This instrument measures the difference in the attraction of the
earth for a mass of one kilogram when that weight is moved
nearer to or farther from the centre of the earth by as little as
one centimetre. Thus placing two weights, of common shape,
each a kilogram, one on top of the other, and two other weights
in the other pan beside one another, would introduce a noteworthy
difference in a comparison.</p>

<h3>Measurement of Time.</h3>

<p>At the very dawn of civilization, the day, however crudely, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
divided into parts. These parts, long afterward, probably in
Babylonia, became the twenty-four hours which have descended
to us. The means of time-keeping came first, in all likelihood,
from measuring the simple shadow of a stick, the gnomon, still
set up as a sun-dial in our gardens. Next
came an hour-glass with its falling sand; the
clepsydra, with its water dropping from a jar;
the burning of candles definite in length. At last came the supreme
discovery that a pendulum, of given length, if kept in one
place oscillates in an unvarying period, be its arc of motion long
or short. Tradition has it that in Arabia, about the year 1000
A. D., the pendulum was used in time-keeping. Granting this to
be true, we must nevertheless give Galileo credit for his independent
discovery as he observed the swaying lamp of the cathedral
at Pisa, early in the seventeenth century. In 1657 Huygens employed
a pendulum in the construction of a clock which, of
course, displayed a new approach to accuracy. In 1792 Borda
and Cassini had improved their time-pieces so as to be correct
within one part in 375,000, that is to one second in 104 hours.
For the sake of portability, clocks were gradually reduced in
size until they became watches. Instead of a pendulum they were
furnished with its equivalent, a balance wheel, Pierre Le Roy
having discovered that there is in every spring a certain length
where all the vibrations, great or small, are performed in approximately
the same period. For actuation, watches were provided
with mainsprings which have steadily undergone improvement
in quality and in placing.</p>

<h3>Time-Pieces Improved.</h3>

<p>Many refinements have brought the time-keeper for the ship,
the observatory, the railroad, to virtual perfection. Its wheels,
pinions, balance-staffs are manufactured automatically,
as at Waltham, Massachusetts, to an
accuracy of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>5000</sub> inch or even less, thanks to
that great inventor, Mr. Duane H. Church. In modern watch-making
the most durable materials are used, magnetic perturbations
are avoided by employing alloys insensitive to magnetism,
and the effects of fluctuating temperatures are withstood by Earnshaw&#8217;s
compensated balance wheel. This wheel is in halves, each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
nearly semicircular and attached at one end to a stout diameter.
Its outer rim, being made of brass, when warmed expands more
than its inner rim of steel. Thus,
in a rising temperature the wheel
curves inward with its duly placed
weights, so that the reduction in
elasticity of the hair-spring caused
by heat is compensated. Experiments
are afoot which look toward
a marked improvement in the
making of time-pieces, by using
invar, a nickel-steel with practically
no expansibility by heat.
This alloy is already employed
for pendulums with satisfactory
results, both at the Naval Observatory
and at the Bureau of Standards, in Washington. It
has been described on <a href="#Page_169">page 169</a>.</p>

<div class="figc300" id="Fig179">

<p class="caption">Earnshaw compensated balance
wheel for watches.</p>
</div>

<h3>The Best Clocks in the World.</h3>

<p>At the Paris Observatory the standard clock, by Winnerl, is in
a vault twenty-seven metres underground. At that depth the
temperature changes are less than one fifth of
a degree during the year, yet the effect of barometric
changes on the rate of the clock have
proved to be serious. This difficulty is
avoided in the Naval Observatory at Washington, by enclosing
the standard clock in an air-tight case within which the air is
reduced to a pressure lower than that ever shown by a barometer
at that level. To avoid risks of air leaking through this case were
it to be pierced by a moving axle, this clock is actuated by weights
lifted electrically by a small primary battery. The slight electric
current required has no perturbing effect on the clock. This time-piece,
provided with an escapement of great excellence, was
manufactured by Clemens Riefler of Munich.</p>

<p>At the Observatory of the Case School of Applied Science,
Cleveland, Ohio, another Riefler clock has a mean error of but
.015 second per day. This means that in a year the total error is
not more than 5.475 seconds, or one part in 5,760,000 of the 365<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
days. Such errors, minute as they are, give a good deal of
trouble when they are irregular, that is, when the clock is sometimes
slow, sometimes fast, in a fashion apparently lawless.
When the divergences are
fairly constant they can
usually be traced to their
source, making it feasible to
apply a remedy.</p>

<h3>Ascertaining the Force of Gravity.</h3>

<p>A pendulum which swings
once in a second at the base
of a tall tower will require
for the same travel a little
more than a second when
borne to the top of the tower,
because then further from
the centre of the earth. Still
greater will be the difference
in its periods as it swings
first at the base of a mountain
and next at its summit.
A pendulum, therefore, is a
means of learning the force
of gravity at a given place,
and without sacrifice of accuracy
it is well that it
should be as small as possible.
In 1890, Professor
T. C. Mendenhall, then
superintendent of the United
States Coast and Geodetic
Survey, designed a pendulum
one fourth the length of those
previously used, and of admirable
precision. Afterward pendulums were built of dimensions
further reduced to about two and one
half inches in length, with periods of oscillation
of one fourth of a second. Such pendulums
are easily carried to stations difficult of access, and have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
been employed on the summits of high mountains, including
Pike&#8217;s Peak: their indications agree well with those of the larger
and somewhat cumbersome apparatus previously used.</p>

<h3>Heat Measured.</h3>

<p>Much the most convenient means of measuring temperature is
the common glass tube filled with mercury. This metal is chosen
because a liquid, and because it varies extremely
in bulk when warmed or cooled. Materials of
parallel susceptibility are adopted for instruments
which measure the intensity of magnetism or of electricity,
the working core of the instrument being made of a substance
highly responsive to magnetism or to electricity.</p>

<p>A mercurial thermometer, for all its convenience, has its accuracy
assailed on more sides than one. When the barometric
pressure rises, the bulb is compressed; when the barometer falls,
the bulb enlarges by virtue of the diminution in atmospheric pressure.
Further, when its graduated tube is upright the mercury
exerts a distending pressure which introduces error. At all temperatures
the metal is giving off a vapor which has tension, in its
upper ranges entailing marked inaccuracies. The glass itself of
which the instrument is made, when of ordinary composition,
spontaneously undergoes changes of volume. While this is a
minor source of error it may be almost completely avoided by
using a boro-silicate glass from the factory of Schott &amp; Genossen,
at Jena. Other substances than mercury are employed in thermometers
with gratifying results. Hydrogen gas is found very
suitable within the interval from -30&deg; to 200&deg; Centigrade. Pentane
serves in temperatures reaching down to -180&deg;.</p>

<p>But it is in alliances with electricity that the measurement of
heat has its broadest scope and utmost exactitude. It was long
ago remarked that heating a metallic conductor increases its resistance
to the flow of an electric current; to measure that
resistance in a platinum wire serves, therefore, to measure its
temperature. An instrument on this principle is the bolometer of
the late Professor S. P. Langley, of Washington. Through a
strip of platinum barely <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>500</sub> inch in width, and less than <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>5000</sub>
inch in thickness, a current of electricity flows continuously.
When radiation, visible or invisible, on occasion from a star, falls
upon it, the strip when warmed by as little as one millionth of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
degree duly records the fact. An instrument, modified from the
Crookes radiometer by Professor E. F. Nichols of Columbia University,
New York, is more sensitive still. An exhausted hollow
metal block has a window of fluorite, a mineral transparent to
ether vibrations of a long range of frequencies. Suspended inside
the block is a fine quartz fibre supporting a horizontal bar, at the
ends of which are attached thin plates of mica, blackened on one
side. Rays passing through the fluorite window strike the blackened
side of the mica, which is parallel and opposite to it. The
resulting rise in temperature causes the vane to revolve against
the torsion of the quartz fibre. The angle of torsion when thermal
equilibrium is reached, measures the intensity of the incident
radiation.</p>

<p>Another principle is adopted in the electrical instruments which
expose to heat a junction of two different materials, usually
metallic, giving rise to an electric current, easily measured. Experience
shows that the most satisfactory couples for temperatures
between 300&deg; C. (570&deg; F.) and 1600&deg; C. (2900&deg; F.) are those
devised by M. Le Chatelier, one half consisting of pure platinum,
the other half an alloy of ten per cent. rhodium and ninety per
cent. platinum. Such instruments are indispensable in the arts
which employ high temperatures. In producing chlorine by the
Deacon process, or in the baking of porcelain, an undue variation
of temperature of only twenty degrees may cause a complete
failure of the operation.</p>

<h3>The Measurement of Light.</h3>

<p>It is probable that about one half the electricity from the
dynamos of America is sent into lamps, and this is but part of
the whole outlay for light, still chiefly produced
by petroleum and gas. Hence the importance
of measuring the light from lamps,
jets, and mantles of various kinds, and testing
the efficiency of shades and reflectors. First of all comes the decision
as to a standard for comparison. Great Britain has adopted
the Harcourt lamp, consuming pentane, as a standard for ten
candle-power, referring to the old time candle of spermaceti.
Germany employs the amylacetate lamp introduced by Von Hefner
Alteneck, as a standard for its Hefner unit of illumination.
Both lamps share in a difficulty which attends all combustion:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
atmospheric conditions which vary from hour to hour, from place
to place, greatly affect the intensity of a flame. Hence incandescent
lamps, which have been compared with these fundamental
standards, are used as working standards. They can be operated
by a uniform current of specified voltage, and after a hundred
hours&#8217; use their constancy of radiation for a considerable period
is remarkable.</p>

<div class="figc500" id="Fig181">
<img src="images/illo271.png" alt="" width="500" height="218" />
<p class="caption">Photometer. A, standard candle. B, gas flame. S, sliding frame.</p>
</div>

<p>Having settled upon a standard candle or lamp the measurement
of light demands extreme care, and, at the best, can never
approach the accuracy of other laboratory measurements. Many
photometers have been invented, some of them highly elaborate,
but the type oftenest used remains in essence the simple <a href="#Fig181">instrument</a>
long ago devised by Bunsen. On a frame supported by a
stand, S, is stretched a sheet of white paper in the centre of which
is a grease spot. This spot allows more light to pass through
it and consequently reflects less than the unmarked portion of
the paper. If the sheet is more strongly lighted from behind
than from in front, it appears bright on a dark ground. If it is
illuminated more strongly in front than at the back it will seem
dark upon a bright ground. When equal lights fall on both sides,
the spot becomes invisible, since it can then appear neither darker
nor brighter than the surrounding paper. In its simplest use the
screen is placed between a standard candle or lamp at A and the
light to be measured at B: the screen is moved along its graduated
slide until the grease spot vanishes. If the screen is twice as far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
from B as from A when the spot disappears, then B is four times
as intense as A in light; if the screen were thrice as far from B
as from A, then B would be nine-fold as bright as A, the intensity
of light diminishing as the square of the distance of its source.</p>

<p>An open-arc lamp, without a reflector, sends to the ground a
fairly wide ring of brilliant rays; on both sides of that ring the
illumination is feeble. Other sources of light also vary a good
deal in the brilliancy of the beams which they emit in various
planes. It is therefore usual to measure the light from a lamp as
sent forth in all planes, or at least in its principal planes. When
incandescent lamps are brought to a photometer they are as a
rule placed on a spindle turning so swiftly that their mean horizontal
candle-power may be read at once. For measuring the
mean spherical intensity a photometer devised by Professor Matthews
of Purdue University is employed. This apparatus has a
series of mirrors arranged in a semicircle around a lamp, reflecting
all the received light upon a single surface.</p>

<p>Light may have great brilliancy and yet be undesirable from
its color; we are all familiar with the havoc that gas light may
play with hues of blossom and leaf that in sunshine are beautiful.
Through ages untold the human eye has been seeing by rays from
the sun, and from immemorial habit is best served by light of
similar quality. A simple instrument, the spectrometer, casts
upon a screen the spectrum from a mercury tube, a Nernst lamp,
a Welsbach mantle, or other illuminant, and enables us to compare
it with the spectrum of sunshine. Then, as in placing a light
pink shade over a Welsbach mantle, we act on the intimations of
analysis greatly to the relief of the eye.</p>

<p>An incandescent bulb or mantle may be satisfactory both in
brilliancy and color, but a further question is, How long will the
filament or the mantle last, and at what point in deterioration
should it be discarded? Tests during the first, the fiftieth, the
hundredth, and other successive hours will tell us how much
the intensity falls off. Just when a bulb or a mantle should be
dismissed from service depends partly on the rate of deterioration,
and partly on the prices of bulbs and current, of mantles and
gas.</p>

<p>Hardly less important than testing sources of light is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
investigation of their reflectors and shades. As a rule our lamps
are too brilliant, and in many cases they send their light in wasteful
directions. It is a general and absurd practice to buy a
dollar&#8217;s worth of light and then kill sixty cents&#8217; worth of it with
a thick opal or cut-glass shade. Examination with the photometer
has revealed that many popular patterns of reflectors and
shades are most ineffective, while those of the Holophane make,
when kept scrupulously clean, send the light just where it does
most good and at the lowest possible expenditure of energy. This
theme has attention on <a href="#Page_78">page 78</a>.<a name="FNanchor_28"

<h3>The Sky as a Field for Measurement.</h3>

<p>The sky has been the supreme field for measurements more
refined from age to age. Professor William Stanley Jevons, in
&#8220;Principles of Science,&#8221; says: &#8220;At Greenwich
Observatory in the present day, the hundredth
part of a second is not thought an inconsiderable
portion of time. The ancient Chaldeans
recorded an eclipse to the nearest hour, and
even the early Alexandrian astronomers thought it superfluous to
distinguish between the edge and centre of the sun. By the introduction
of the astrolabe, Ptolemy and the later Alexandrian
astronomers could determine the places of the heavenly
bodies within about ten minutes of arc. But little progress then
ensued for thirteen centuries, until Tycho Brahe made the first
great step toward accuracy, not only by employing better instruments,
but even more by ceasing to regard an instrument as correct.
Tycho, in fact, determined the errors of his instruments,
and corrected his observations. He also took notice of the effects
of atmospheric refraction, and succeeded in attaining an accuracy
often sixty times as great as that of Ptolemy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet Tycho and Hevelius often erred several minutes in the
determination of a star&#8217;s place, and it was a great achievement of
Roemer and Flamsteed to reduce this error to seconds. Bradley,
the modern Hipparchus, carried on the improvement, his errors
in right ascension being under one second of time, and those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
declination under four seconds of arc according to Bessel. In the
present day the average error of a single observation is probably
reduced to the half or quarter of what it was in Bradley&#8217;s time;
and further extreme accuracy is attained by the multiplication of
observations, and their skilful combination according to the
method of least squares. Some of the more important constants,
for instance that of nutation, have been determined within the
tenth part of a second of arc.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be a matter of great interest to trace out the dependence
of this vast progress upon the introduction of new instruments.
The astrolabe of Ptolemy, the telescope of Galileo, the
pendulum of Galileo and Huygens, the micrometer of Horrocks,
and the telescopic sights and micrometer of Gascoyne and Picard,
Roemer&#8217;s transit instrument, Newton&#8217;s and Hadley&#8217;s quadrant,
Dollond&#8217;s achromatic lenses, Harrison&#8217;s chronometer, and Ramsden&#8217;s
dividing engine&mdash;such were some of the principal additions
to astronomical apparatus. The result is that we now take note
of quantities <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>300,000</sub> or <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>400,000</sub> the size of the smallest observable
in the time of the Chaldeans.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Electricity Measured.</h3>

<p>As important as the measurements of the astronomer are those
of the electrician. It was as recently as 1819 that Oersted, a
Danish physicist, published a discovery which
became a foundation stone of electrical engineering,
and upon which rises the art of electrical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
measurement. He observed that when an electric current is
passing through a wire, a nearby magnetic needle tends to place
itself at right angles to the wire, the deflection varying with the
strength of the current. When instead of a wire, a coil, duly insulated,
is employed to carry the current, effects much more decided
are displayed. At first current-measurers, or galvanometers,
employed simple compass needles; these proved to be unsatisfactory.
They were affected by the variations which occur in the
intensity of the earth&#8217;s magnetism; and no matter how carefully
a needle was made, it varied in strength
from week to week, from year to year;
again, a current might be so strong as to
create magnetism overwhelming in comparison
with that of the earth, and quite
beyond the measuring power of a compass
needle. A galvanometer on a plan
due to Professor James Clerk Maxwell,
employs a permanent magnet, or an electro-magnet,
which is stationary, between
the poles of which may freely turn a coil
bearing the current to be measured. This
current in the case of an ocean cable is so
weak that no other means of indication
will serve. Lord Kelvin&#8217;s recording apparatus for such a cable is
a galvanometer on this principle. In order to concentrate the lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
of magnetic force on the vertical sides of the coil, a piece of soft
iron, D, is fixed between the poles of the magnet. This iron becomes
magnetized by induction, so as to produce a very powerful
field of force, in the minute spaces between it and the two magnetic
poles, through which spaces the vertical sides of the coil are
free to move. Instruments of this kind, developed by D&#8217;Arsonval,
are known by his name.</p>

<h3>Weston Instruments.</h3>

<p>Instruments for electrical measurement, with stationary magnets
and moving coils, of great excellence, are manufactured by the
Weston Company, Waverly Park, New Jersey.
Their accuracy rests upon several important
discoveries by Dr. Edward Weston: first, a
method of making a magnet which is really permanent, retaining
its original strength for a long time: second, by the preparation
of a remarkable group of alloys which under ordinary
variations of temperature manifest scarcely any change in conductivity,
and which set up but little thermo-electric action as they
touch other metals in an instrument. Let us see how a Weston
voltmeter, or measurer of electric pressure, is constructed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<div class="figc400" id="Fig185">
<img src="images/illo276.png" alt="" width="400" height="353" />
<p class="caption">Weston voltmeter.</p>
</div>

<p>A light rectangular coil of copper wire, C, is wound on an aluminium
frame pivoted in jeweled bearings so as to be free to
rotate in the ring-like space between an inner cylindrical soft iron
core, K, and the pole pieces P and P of the permanent magnet, M.
A light aluminium pointer, p, is attached to the coil and is free to
move across the scale, D. The current enters the coil through the
two spiral springs S and S, which serve also to control the movement
of the coil. When a current passes through the coil the
dynamic action between the current and the magnetic field tends
to rotate the coil, and the position of equilibrium between this
force and the torsion of the springs, indicated by the pointer,
measures the current passing through the coil. Because the
magnetic field is practically unvarying throughout, and the torsion
of the springs is proportionate to their deflection, the scale is virtually
uniform. This is not assumed in their manufacture, however,
for each instrument is calibrated by direct reference to
standards. As the aluminium frame moves through the magnetic
field, slight currents are generated within the metal; these serve
to dampen vibrations so that the pointer comes to rest almost instantly
without friction. That the magnetic field may have the
utmost strength, the air gap in which the coil rotates is made
as narrow as possible; this is ensured by workmanship of the
highest skill, and by tools specially designed. The hardened steel
pivots are ground and centered as in the best watch-making: the
coil is balanced by means of adjustable weights so that none but
electrical forces may come into play. In a Weston voltmeter of
regular type, the maximum current required for a full scale-deflection
is only 0.01 ampere. Instruments of much higher sensibility
are constructed for measuring insulation, requiring but
0.0006 ampere for the same deflection. So much for the task
of measuring electrical pressure.</p>

<p>For measuring electrical currents, which differ from pressures
as the quantity of water flowing in a pipe differs from the pressure
of that water as shown in a common gauge, a Weston ammeter,
or ampere-meter, may be employed. It is similar to the voltmeter
just described, being in fact a milli-voltmeter actuated by the
difference in electrical potential, or pressure, between the terminals
of a standard resistance, the shunt, through which a definite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
fraction of the current passes. It is as if a known part of
the flow of a river being measured, the volume of the whole
stream is learned.</p>

<p>The two principal alloys discovered by Dr. Weston, and used
in his instruments, are manganin and nickelin. Manganin has
about twenty-five times the resistance of copper, and increases
in resistance about 0.00001 for each degree Centigrade through
which its temperature rises. Nickelin has about twenty-nine times
the resistance of copper, and decreases in resistance about 0.00004
for each degree Centigrade through which its temperature rises.
These and other alloys used in construction are carefully worked
and annealed according to methods perfected in years of experience.
After a wire for an instrument is drawn, its fibres,
being in a state of unequal strain, undergo an artificial aging process
so that their resistance shall remain unchanged after adjustment.
The Weston instruments are based on the international
volt and ampere adopted by the National Bureau of Standards
at Washington. Instruments of the regular portable type have a
guaranteed accuracy of one part in 400, while the laboratory
standard semi-portable instruments are guaranteed to one part in
1000. Weston voltmeters and ammeters are constantly being
checked after years of active service, and are found correct within
the guaranteed limits of accuracy.</p>

<p>This remarkable success testifies to the importance of asking,
What properties are needed in the material of which an instrument
is to be built? That question duly answered, it becomes a task
for research to provide these materials, that skill may put them
together in compact and convenient form.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

In taking notes for this book the author has visited many factories,
works, and mills. In design, equipment, and operation the Weston factory
is the best of them all and quite above criticism. Admirable, too, are
the educational and social features of this establishment.</p></div>

<h3>The Bureau of Standards at Washington.</h3>

<p>Whether in the laboratory of the chemist or the physicist, in
the machine shop or the engine-room, every means of measurement
must be based on standards created with the
highest skill and guarded with the utmost care.
For the United States these ultimate standards,
in full variety, are brought together at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Bureau of Standards at Washington, of which Dr. S. W. Stratton
is director. Here are safeguarded copies of the international
metre and the kilogram adopted by Executive Order in 1893 as
fundamental units of length and mass; here, too, are standard
yards and pounds, bearing fixed legal relations to the international
metre and kilogram. The Bureau is prepared to determine the
length of any standard up to fifty metres, to calibrate its subdivisions,
and to determine its coefficient of expansion for ordinary
temperatures. To the credit of American workmanship be it said
that at times the micrometers received from leading manufacturers,
for use in workshops of the best class, are so refined in
their measurements as to tax to the utmost the resources of the
Bureau. Its precision balances, by Rueprecht of Vienna, and
Stuckrath of Berlin, weigh a kilogram within <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>200</sub> part of a
milligram, that is, within one two-hundred-millionth part of its
load.</p>

<p>In the department of electricity a resistance may be measured
all the way from <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>100,000</sub> of an ohm to 100,000 ohms. Here are
voltmeters, and wattmeters of the best types. Magnetism, as
swiftly summoned or dismissed in the cores of dynamos and
motors, is here measured with the utmost exactitude. In some of
the instruments fused quartz has been used as a means of suspension
because its high elasticity and great strength allow it to be
drawn as extremely fine threads. Dr. K. E. Guthe, now of the
University of Iowa, while at the head of the section of magnetic
measurements, found that fibres equally serviceable may be drawn
from steatite, or soapstone, such as forms a common kind of
gas-burner. Thick quartz threads break easily when bent, those
of steatite do not.</p>

<p>In thermometry, a section in charge of Dr. Waidner, much work
goes forward in testing clinical and other thermometers for manufacturers.
The whole range of heat measurement is covered by
instruments adapted to recording the highest attainable temperatures
until we reach apparatus by which, through observation of
its light, the absolute temperature of the electric arc has been
found to be 3720&deg; C. Measurements of light proceed in another
section. Here a photometer designed by Mr. Edward P. Hyde,
of the Bureau staff, has reached the hitherto unexampled accuracy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
of one part in 200. The Bureau has an extensive workshop where
new designs for improved apparatus are constantly in hand. For
services on behalf of the national or any state government the
Bureau makes no charge; moderate fees are required from firms
and individuals. In its new and adequate quarters the Bureau is
doing work as authoritative as that of any similar institution in
the world.</p>

<h3>Refined Measurement Improves Machinery.</h3>

<p>In manufacturing modern tools and machinery, the thousandth
of an inch is the usual limit of allowable error. A <a href="#Fig186">micrometer
caliper</a> measuring to this limit is here shown.
The pitch of its screw is 40 to the inch, and
the beveled edge of the screw-thimble is divided
into 25 parts, so that motion from one division
to the next takes the screw <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>25</sub> of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>40</sub> of an inch,
or <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>1000</sub>.
By carrying refinement a step farther, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10,000</sub> of an inch can be
detected. The production of a screw such as this was simply
impossible by the lathe as used almost up to the close of the
eighteenth century, its operator holding in his hand a gouge or
chisel. Of inestimable importance was Henry Maudslay&#8217;s invention
of the slide-rest which firmly holds the tool, moving it automatically
along the wood or metal being cut. See <a href="#Fig116">illustration</a> on
page 96. James Watt, as he endeavored to improve the steam
engine, before the slide-rest was invented, was sorely vexed
and thwarted by the ill-shaped containers for steam which served<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
him as cylinders. Perhaps the chief task accomplished by the
lathe has been its own improvement, so that to-day surfaces are
readily cut by its tools accurately
to within a thousandth
part of an inch.
Vastly beyond this feat was
Professor H. A. Rowland&#8217;s
production of a virtually
perfect screw, which enabled
him to rule on concave
gratings 5.9 inches square,
110,000 lines with such
precision that the error between any two of the lines is probably
less than <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3,000,000</sub> of an inch. These gratings brought to view
spectra much more extended and clear than those observable in
a spectroscope, however powerful. The concave plates employed
by Professor Rowland were made by Mr. John A. Brashear of
Allegheny, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Measurement is greatly indebted to accurate means of enlarging
the images of objects as viewed in the telescope or the microscope.
Glass grinding tools are to-day so exquisitely contoured that a lens
forty-two inches in breadth shows the image of a star as an immeasurable
dot. It was in pressing together two lenses of very
large and known radius that Newton measured the lengths of
light-waves. With homogeneous rays, such as those of yellow
light, the successive rings of light and darkness marked the
points at which the intervals between his lenses were equal to
half a light-vibration or any multiple thereof. Measuring these
intervals, by noting their distances from the common centre of
his lenses, he found the wave-length of the particular light he
was studying.</p>

<h3>Interchangeability Old and New.</h3>

<p>The cheap duplication of products, so wonderfully expanded
of late years, had its germ long before the Christian era, when in
Babylonia a builder first made bricks in a mold,
and took care by careful measurement to keep
to uniform dimensions in his output. Because
any brick matched any other from the same
mold, he introduced a new beauty and regularity in architecture,
he made it easy to extend
or repair a wall, a gateway,
a battlement. So it
was afterward with the
tiles, also made in molds,
which were laid as floors
or roofs; and the piping,
likewise molded, for water-supply
or drainage. To-day
when a housekeeper
replaces her worn-out
stove-linings, and a printer
increases his stock of type,
they enjoy a direct inheritance
from the first
molders of bricks and tiles,
cups and bowls. In a modern factory vast sums are expended in
producing the original patterns, molded or copied perhaps ten
million times, so that their cost, in so far as represented in each
manufactured hook or lever, is next to nothing. Much expense,
also, is entailed in making the jigs which guide the tools used in
lathes or milling machines to turn out the cases of voltmeters, or
a complicated valve-seat. A jig may cost a hundred dollars and
its use may require rare steadiness of hand, the utmost keenness
of eye; all the while the operator&#8217;s wife, at home, avails herself
of an aid based on the very same principle. What else is the
paper pattern according to which she cuts out a collar, an apron,
a baby&#8217;s bib?</p>

<p>In machinery the first introduction of an interchangeability of
parts was by General Gribeauval, in the French artillery service,
about 1765. He reduced gun-carriages to classes, and so arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
many of their parts that they could be applied to any carriage of
the class for which they were made. These parts were stamped,
not forged. The next step
in this direction was taken in
America and, as in France, its
aim was to improve instruments
of war. Eli Whitney,
famous as the inventor of
the cotton gin, secured a
contract from the United States Government for 10,000 firearms.
These he manufactured almost wholly by stamping. He introduced
machinery for shaping and, as far as then feasible, the finishing
of each part. He also employed a system of gauges, by which uniformity
of construction was assured for every gun produced.
Next came J. H. Hall, of Harper&#8217;s Ferry, Virginia, who in 1818
made every similar part of a gun of such size and shape as to suit
any other gun, improving some details of importance.</p>

<div class="figc350" id="Fig190">
<img src="images/illo283.png" alt="" width="350" height="114" />
<p class="caption">Flat jig, or guide.</p>
</div>

<p>The modern designer of tools, implements and machines takes
care that the parts upon which wear chiefly comes are easily removable
so as to be cheaply replaced. A worn out plowshare is
renewed for a dollar or two, keeping the plow as a whole substantially
new. Should the pinion of a watch be destroyed by
accident, it is duplicated from Waltham or Elgin for a few cents.</p>

<p>To-day rods, wires, screws, bolts, tubes, nails, sheets of metal,
are made in standard sizes. Much the same is true of rails for
railroads, girders, eye-bars for bridges, and the like. Thus the
product of any factory or mill may be used to piece out or to repair
work turned out by any other similar concern. Yet more, if a
subway or a tunnel is to be built in a hurry, two or more steel-works
may co-operate in furnishing beams, columns, or aught
else, with no departure from ordinary gauges. Steel works in
Pennsylvania have produced every detail for a bridge erected in
Africa, a factory in Germany, a stamp mill in Canada. At the
World&#8217;s Congress of electricians held in Chicago in 1893, units
were adopted as international standards, a noteworthy step toward
adopting universal standards in all branches of engineering. Here
progress is to some extent held back by firms and corporations
that produce patterns not always worthy of defence. Standard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
forms and dimensions, especially in manufactures for a world-market,
are only decided upon after thorough discussion, so that
they are judiciously chosen. Among feasible shapes and sizes for
rails, columns, girders, and the rest, one is usually best, or a few
are best. Why not exhaust every reasonable means of ascertaining
which these are for specific tasks that they may be freely
chosen? Then if individuality prefers its own different designs,
let it do so knowing what the indulgence costs.</p>

<h3>A Test Shows How Concrete May be Cheaply Strengthened.</h3>

<p>Measurements may be conducted in the strict spirit of scientific
research, not immediately directed to industrial ends. Methods
thus perfected are more and more being
adopted for large questions of industry. Let
an example be presented from the field, briefly
touched upon in this book, of concrete as a
material for the builder. Says Mr. C. H. Umstead
of Washington, Pennsylvania<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Many thousands of tons of the finer grades of stones from the
crushers all over the country are rejected by engineers for use in
concrete foundations and walls, sand being preferred at greatly
increased cost. I prepared seventy-two three-inch cubes with
quartz sand and with varying proportions of crushed stone which
was going to the dump as unfit for foundation work, and submitted
them to crushing tests at periods of fourteen and twenty-eight
days. The proportion of Portland cement was constant.&#8221;</p>

<p>From Mr. Umstead&#8217;s table of results the following figures are
chosen; on comparing those for the first and third cubes they show
that a gain in strength of forty-three per cent, followed upon
using six pounds of crusher refuse instead of five and one half
pounds of sand.</p>

<p>So much for the value of a test in the improvement of an important
manufacture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Umstead&#8217;s full report appeared in 1903, in the third volume
of bulletins published by the American Society for Testing Materials.
This Society, whose secretary is Professor Edgar Marburg
of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, is affiliated with
the International Association for Testing Materials, one of the
most important agencies in existence for providing the engineer
with trustworthy data.</p>

<h3>Industrial Uses of Measurement.</h3>

<p>Measurement industrially is taking on a new and rapidly extending
scope. It is of great moment that a railroad or a steamship,
a factory or a mill, should be built of the
best materials in the most economical way, that
it should be equipped with the most efficient
boilers, engines, machines, and lamps: in effect,
that every dollar be expended for the utmost possible value.</p>

<p>At Altoona the Pennsylvania Railroad Company has a laboratory
for testing the materials which go into its roadbed, bridges,
tracks, rolling stock, buildings, telegraph, and signal systems.
Every gallon of oil, each incandescent lamp, car axle, or boiler
plate accepted by the Company must pass a due test in a continuous
series of competitive examinations. The huge scale of
such a Company&#8217;s purchases, the strains placed upon its equipment
by a service growing in extent and in speed, make this
course indispensable. Take another case, this time in New York,
at the power-house of the Interborough Company in West 59th
Street. There every day a fair sample of the coal brought to the
dock is burned, and its heat-units ascertained as a basis for payment.
With a consumption which may rise to 1500 tons a day
this precaution is obligatory.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_30" id="Footnote_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a>
The United States Geological Survey, Washington, D. C., in 1906 published
a report on the coal testing plant at the Exposition, St. Louis, Mo.,
1904. Part I, Field work, classification of coals, chemical work. Part II,
Boiler tests. Part III, Producer-gas, coking, briquetting, and washing tests.
This report, with elaborate tables and many illustrations, is of great value.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania R. R. Co., Philadelphia, in 1905 published a large
and handsomely illustrated volume, &#8220;Locomotive tests and exhibits, St.
Louis, 1904.&#8221; $5.00. The locomotives represented the best American
practice of 1904. Every detail of construction and operation is given in
the most instructive manner.</p>

<p>The Company is continuing these tests of locomotives at Altoona, Pa.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>On quite other lines, equally important, the ascertainment of
values proceeds at laboratories thoroughly organized for the purpose
by staffs at the service of the public. In the United States
the first in rank of such laboratories are grouped at the Bureau
of Standards in Washington. At leading universities and technological
institutes throughout the Union are other laboratories well
equipped for chemical, physical, and engineering tests. At the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, for example, is
an Emery testing apparatus for making compression tests of
specimens up to eighteen feet in length, for tension specimens up
to thirteen feet. In Europe analogous institutions are supplemented
by the Board of Trade Laboratories in London, the Laboratoire
Central in Paris, the Reichsanstalt in Berlin. The Electrical
Testing Laboratories, a joint-stock concern, has been established
in New York, at Eightieth Street and East End Avenue, for
similar tasks in so far as they come within the electrical field. Its
direction in ability and character is authoritative. Here is some of
the best apparatus in the world for tests of the permeability of
magnet iron, of the light from incandescent, arc, or other electric
lamps, of gas-burners and mantles, of the extent to which reflectors
and globes fulfil their purpose, and so on.</p>

<p>It is altogether probable that this concern will be copied in
every other large city of the Union. When an electrical plant is
installed it is not enough that the specifications be drawn with
care, it is necessary that verifications of quality follow upon delivery
of dynamos, motors, lamps, and all else. Tests should be
continuous: let us suppose that for a specific task of illumination
Nernst lamps are selected. All very well, but the question is,
What quality has each lamp? Buyers in cases of this kind are
more and more referring rival manufactures to tests which settle,
as in a court of final appeal, differences upon which they themselves
are incompetent to pass. Not only in sale but in production
these tests are of the first importance. If a copper refinery turns
out from the same batch of crude metal two samples which vary
by a thousandth in electrical conductivity, it is worth while knowing
every detail which may explain how the better sample was
produced. So likewise in the drawing of wire, the alloying of
lead with other metals for anti-friction bearings, and so on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>It is altogether likely that recourse to authoritative tests will
soon become general. Before many years elapse we may see
private and public laboratories multiplied for the comparison of
building and road-making materials, fuel, boilers, engines, machines,
lubricants, finished goods of all kinds. In the textile industry,
for instance, much is said about the waste entailed in mixing
sound wool with shoddy, long staple cotton with short inferior
brands. Let pure and adulterated fabrics be compared in resistance
to wear, and let the effects of scouring, bleaching, dyeing,
and mechanical washing be measured. In another field Professor
W. O. Atwater has done much to ascertain the nourishing
value of foods: his labors might well be extended full circle, not
omitting tests of popular medicaments and common drugs.</p>

<h3>Expert Planning and Reform.</h3>

<p>To-day engineers of mark are engaged not only to plan a
power-house, a flour mill, a steel works or other vast installation,
but also to examine industrial plants established
long ago and enlarged from time to
time in an unsystematic way. Armed with
scales, pressure-gauges, indicators, voltmeters,
they ascertain the cost of a horse-power-hour, of making a pound
of flour, copper wire, or aught else. They note how speeds may
be heightened with profit, as by using suitable brands of high-speed
steels. They suggest how a pattern may be adopted in the
foundry which will lessen machining; how by-products now
thrown away may be turned to account. They point out how
quality may be improved by the adoption of new machines which
may, furthermore, demand unskilled instead of skilled attendance.
They may advise, from a wide outlook on the whole field
of American experience, a method for equalizing output throughout
the day and throughout the year, as when a central-lighting
station sells current at a large discount during the hours when
no lamps are aglow, so that ice may be manufactured at such
periods, or batteries restored for use in automobiles and motor-boats.
Mr. Wilson S. Howell, of New York, a few years ago
became convinced that a neglected branch of economy in central
lighting stations was the maintaining a uniform voltage. He succeeded
in reducing fluctuations in many plants to the unexampled
figure of four per cent. The result was that he lowered the current<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
necessary for an Edison lamp from 3.6 watts to 3.1 watts per
candle-power, a saving of one seventh. Mr. M. K. Eyre, another
well-known engineer, once took charge of a lamp factory in Ohio.
In four months he had reduced cost forty per cent. while producing
a lamp of the best quality. An electric lighting and power
property which for years had been unprofitable was placed in the
hands of Messrs. J. G. White &amp; Company of New York, an engineering
firm of the first rank. Within a few months the property
was earning a substantial surplus; the ratio of operating to
gross earnings was reduced about thirty per cent., and the gross
earnings showed an increase over corresponding months of the
previous year of nearly forty per cent. Economies quite as striking
have been effected by the firm of Messrs. Dodge &amp; Day of
Philadelphia. On request investigators of this stamp, whose aim
is to abolish waste and promote efficiency, go beyond mechanical
and engineering details. They may point out how needed working
capital may be obtained, how best to extend sales, and possibly
how an economical consolidation with other similar plants
may be effected. Almost invariably it is found imperative to recast
the bookkeeping methods, especially with regard to ascertaining
the cost of production in each department. Drawing
upon experience recommendations may follow as to premium
plans of paying wages, and other methods of identifying the
interests of employers and employed.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
Approved schemes for the
comfort and welfare of work people are also suggested by counsellors
thoroughly aware that contentment is great gain, that
pure air, good light, and the utmost feasible safety, contribute to
the balance sheet not less than the quickest lathe tools or the best
wound dynamo.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_31" id="Footnote_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a>
Mr. T. S. Halsey is a contributor to &#8220;Trade Unionism and Labor
Problems,&#8221; published by Ginn &amp; Co., Boston, 1905. He recites (p. 284)
how a corporation had manufactured a product again and again. Both
workmen and foreman were positive that the working time was at the
minimum. The premium plan of payment was introduced, with a reduction
in time of 41 per cent. as the result.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
NATURE AS TEACHER</h2>

<p class="chaptoc">Forces take paths of least resistance .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Accessibility decides where
cities shall arise .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Plants display engineering principles in structure.
Lessons from the human heart, eye, bones, muscles, and nerves .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What
nature has done, art may imitate,&mdash;in the separation of oxygen
from air, in flight, in producing light, in converting heat into work .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Lessons
from lower animals .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A hammer-using wasp.</p>

<p class="chapstart">Beyond their unending study of forms and properties, their
constant weighing and measuring, the inventor and his
twin-brother, the discoverer, have a gainful province which now
for a little space will engage our attention. This province is
nothing else than Nature, which begins by offering primitive man
stones for hammers, arrowheads, knives; sticks to serve as clubs,
paddles, harrows or tent-poles. We may well believe that the
lowest savages have always exercised some degree of choice even
here; it would be the soundest and sharpest stone that they
picked up when a rude axe was needed. Should only blunt stones
be found, then in giving one of them an edge was taken a first
step in art, rewarded with a tool as good as the axe found ready
to hand in some earlier quest. Nature is not only a giver of much
besides stones and sticks, she is virtually a great contriver whose
feats may incite the inventor to reach her goals if he can; his
path will probably differ widely enough from hers as he arrives
at success.</p>

<h3>Forces Take the Easiest Paths.</h3>

<p>When one drop of rain meets another, and they join themselves
to thousands more on the crest of a hill, they need no
guide posts to show them the easiest course to
the valley. They simply take it under the quiet
pull of gravity. When a bolt of lightning darts
across the sky, its lines, chaotic as they seem,
are just the paths where the electric pulses find least obstruction.
If a volcano, which has boiled and throbbed for ages, at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
opens a chasm on a hapless shore, as that of Martinique, we may
be sure that at that point and nowhere else the mighty caldron&#8217;s
lid was lightest. A cavern in Kentucky, or Virginia, slowly
broadening and deepening through uncounted rills which dissolve
its limy walls, comes at last to utter collapse: the breach marking
exactly where an ounce too much pressed the roof at its frailest
seam. In these cases as in all others, however complex, matter
moves inevitably in the path of least resistance. To imitate that
economy of effort is from first to last the inventor&#8217;s task.</p>

<h3>Cities and Roads.</h3>

<p>Rains, winds and frosts, in their sculpture of the earth have
each taken the easiest course; in so doing they have incidentally
marked out the best paths for human feet, have
pointed to the best sites for the homes of men.
The stresses of defence may rear a pueblo on
the peak of a perpendicular cliff in New Mexico, but Paris and
London, like Rome, must have all roads leading to their gates;
and the easier and shorter these roads, the bigger and stronger
the city will become. Where New York, Montreal, Chicago, and
Pittsburg now stand, the Indians long ago had the wit to found
goodly settlements. They knew, as well as their white successors,
the advantages of paths readily traversed, and no longer
than need be. In this regard there was an instructive contrast at
the outset of railroad building in England. A leading engineer,
who planned some of the earliest English railways, had strong
mathematical prepossessions: he endeavored to join the terminals
of his routes by lines as nearly straight as he could. George
Stephenson, for his part, had no mathematical warp of any kind,
but instead much sound sense; his lines followed the courses of
rivers and valleys, and kept, as much as might be, to the chief
indentations of the sea. His roads deviated a good deal from
straightness, but they did so profitably; whereas the lines of his
academic rival, disrespecting the hints and indications of nature,
were much less gratifying from an investor&#8217;s point of view. If
a traveler takes the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad
from New York to Buffalo he goes north for 143 miles, to
Albany, before he begins to travel westward at all. Yet this
line, keeping as it does to the well-peopled levels of the Hudson
and Mohawk Valleys and serving their succession of cities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
towns, and villages, enjoys the best business, and makes better
time between its terminals than any rival route, because it passes
around instead of over its hills and mountains. By way of contrast
we turn to the railroad map of Russia and observe how
Moscow and St. Petersburg are joined by a line which follows
the road which it is said that Peter the Great, with military
exigencies in view, laid down with a pencil and ruler.</p>

<div class="figc400" id="Fig191">
<img src="images/illo291.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="318" />
<p class="caption">Deciduous cypress, <i>Taxodium distichum</i>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Engineering Principles in Vegetation.</h3>

<p>If the engineer has many a golden hint spread before him in
the hills and dales, the streams and oceans of the world, not less
fruitful is the study of what takes place just
beneath the surface of the earth where the
roots of grain and shrub, reed and tree, take
life and form. Plant a kernel of wheat in the
ground and note how its rootlets pierce the soil, extending always
from the tip. They need no gardener or botanist to bid them
lengthen and thicken where food chiefly abounds. In an arid
plain of Arizona a vine, in ground parched and dry, goes downward
so far, and spreads its fibrils so much abroad, as soon to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
show ten times as much growth below the drifting sands as above
them. In fertile, well-watered soil the same vine descends less
than half as far, and yet with
more gain. A bald cypress
in a swamp of Florida responds
to different surroundings
with equal profit.
Finding its food near the
surface its roots take horizontal
lines, at no great
depth in the soil. Every
wind that stirs these roots
but promotes their thrift and
strengthens their anchorage.
A wealth of sustenance
floats in the swamp water. In seizing it and being thereby fed,
the roots develop &#8220;knees&#8221;; these brace the tree so firmly against
tempests as to win admiration from the engineer. When the
progeny of this cypress grow on well-drained land, the knees
do not appear, while the roots within a narrowed area strike deep.
Thus simply in doing what its surroundings incite it to do, the
tree acts as if it had intelligence, as if it consciously saw and
chose what would do it most good.</p>

<div class="figc350" id="Fig192">
<img src="images/illo292.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="247" />
<p class="caption">Deciduous cypress, hypothetical
diagram.</p>
</div>

<p>Lumbermen in the North observe much the same responsiveness.
In a grove of pines they see that the trees which stand close
together are tall and cylindrical. When all the pines but one in a
cluster are cut down, that one will speedily thicken the lower part
of its trunk by virtue of the increased action of the winds, just
as a muscle thickens by exercise.</p>

<h3>The Gain of Responsiveness.</h3>

<p>So also is there responsiveness when we look upon the life of
plants in the large. As the traits of a shrub or tree are borne
into its seed many a thousand impulses are
merged and mingled. Little wonder that their
delicate accord and poise should be slightly
different from those of the seeds from which the parents sprang.
Let us suppose these parents to be cactuses, and that the offspring
displays an unusually broad stem, of less surface comparatively
than any other plant in its group. In a soil seldom refreshed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
rain, this cactus has the best foothold and maintains it with most
vigor. Sandstorms which kill brethren less sturdy, strike it in
vain, so that its kind is multiplied. Wherever such a new character
as this gives a plant an advantage, it holds the field while its
neighbors perish. Thus arises a high premium on every useful
variation, be it in new stockiness of form, an acridity which repels
vermin, or a strength which readily makes a way through sun-baked
earth. Hence such new traits are, as it were, seized upon
and become points of departure for new varieties, and in the
fullness of time, for new species. About a hundred years ago
a gardener imagined a tuberous begonia, and then proceeded step
by step toward its creation by breeding from every flower that
varied in the direction he desired. This man, and all his kindred
who have added to our riches in cultivated blooms, have no more
than copied the modes of nature which, at the end of ages, bestows
as free gifts every wildflower of the field and hedgerow. If the
botanist of to-day is the master of a plastic art, so is the cattle-breeder
who chalks on a barn-door the outline of a beeve he
wishes to produce, and then straightway plans the matings which
issue in the animal he has pictured. Artificial selection, such as
this, is after all only imitation of that natural selection which has
derived the horse from a progenitor little larger than a fox, in
response, age after age, to changing food, climate, enemies, and
the needs of his human master.</p>

<h3>Scope for Imitation.</h3>

<p>Fields remote from those of the naturalist are just as instructive.
The inventor sets before himself an end with conscious
purpose, and then seeks means to reach that
end, but at best his methods may be wasteful
and imperfect. Nature, with unhasting tread,
acting simply through the qualities inherent in her materials,
through their singular powers of combination, of mutual adaptability,
shows the discoverer results which to understand even in
small measure tax his keenest wit, or displays to him structures
at times beyond his skill to dissect, much less to imitate. Mechanic
art, indeed, is for the most part but a copy of nature, as
when the builder repeats the mode in which rocks are found
in caves, in ridges at the verge of a cliff, or in the stratifications
which underlie a county, all conducing to permanence of form, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
resistance against abrading sand or dissolving waters. What
ensures the stability of a lighthouse but its repetition of a tree-trunk
in its contour? Engines and machines recall the animal
body, grinding ore much as teeth grind nuts, lifting water as the
heart pumps blood through artery and vein, and repeating in
mechanism of brass and steel the dexterity of fingers, the blows
of fists. When an inventor builds an engine to drive a huge ship
across the sea, he has created a motor vastly larger than his own
frame, but much inferior in economy. At a temperature little
higher than that of a summer breeze the human mechanism transmutes
the energy of fuel into mechanical toil: for the same duty,
less efficiently discharged, the steam engine demands a blaze almost
fierce enough to melt grate bars of iron.</p>

<p>Heat is costly, so that its conservation is an art worth knowing.
In the ashes strewn and piled on burning lava nature long ago
told us how heat may be secured against dissipation. Other of
her garments, as hair and fur, obstruct the escape of heat in a
remarkable degree, and so does bark, especially when loosely
coherent as in the cork tree. Feathers are also excellent retainers
of heat, and have thereby so much profited their wearers, that
Ernest Ingersoll holds that the development of feathers has had
much to do with advancing birds far above their lowly cousins,
the reptiles clad in a scaly vesture.</p>

<h3>Strength of the Cylinder.</h3>

<p>As we look back upon the past from the vantage ground of
modern insight we see that men of the loftiest powers could be
blind to intimations now plain and clear. Many
a time have designers and inventors paralleled,
without knowing it, some structure of nature
often seen but never really observed. All the variety and beauty
of the Greek orders of architecture failed to include the arch;
yet the contour of every architect&#8217;s own skull was the while displaying
an arched form which could lend to temple and palace
new strength as well as grace. The skeleton of the foot reveals
in the instep an arch of tarsal and metatarsal bones, with all the
springiness which their possessor may confer upon a composite
arch of wood or steel. Modern builders, whether wittingly or
not, have taken a leaf from the book of nature in rearing their
tallest structures with hollow cylinders of steel. What is this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
but borrowing the form of the reed, the bamboo, a thousand
varieties of stalk, one of the strongest shapes in which supporting
material can be disposed? Pass a knife across a blade of pipe or
moor grass and you will find a hollow cylinder stayed by buttresses
numbering nearly a score. More elaborate and even more
gainful is the way in which tissue grows in the columns of dead-nettles
and bulrushes. The bones in one&#8217;s arms and legs resemble
the hollow cylinders of which these stalks show instructive
variations, so that without going beyond his own frame the designer
could long ago have learned a golden lesson. How bone
is joined to bone is scarcely less remarkable, as in the braces of
the thigh bone as it joins the trunk. As bones move upon each
other all shock is prevented by a highly elastic cushion: the
springs of vehicles, the buffers of railroad trains, but repeat the
cartilages in the joints of their inventors.</p>

<p>In the theodolite and sextant, in the geometric lathe of the
bank-note engraver, are ball-and-socket joints allowing motion in
any plane. Equally free in their movements are the shoulder and
hip joints, while their surfaces are lubricated by a delicate synovial
fluid supplied just as it is wanted. When pumps first received
valves to direct their flow in one direction, their inventor
was no doubt gratified at his skill. In the heart within his own
breast, in his veins and arteries, were simple valves engaged in a
similar task as they directed the currents of his blood. In pumps
such as are common in farm-yards, the action is jerky, the stream
flowing and ebbing from moment to moment as the arm rises and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
falls. The tide of human blood would have the same uneven
pulse were it not for the elasticity of its arterial walls. Their
elasticity serves to equalize the flow, much as the air does in
large chambers on pumps for mines or waterworks.</p>

<h3>The Heart and the Built-up Gun.</h3>

<p>Examination of the heart brings out a principle in its structure
closely paralleled in modern invention. Guns of old were cast
or forged as ordinary columns or shafts are
to-day, the strength of the metal being virtually
uniform throughout when the guns were
at rest on their trunnions. As explosive
charges more and more powerful were employed, these guns
gave way, the pressure of the exploding gases stretching the
metal at the bore to rupture, before the outer metal could add its
resistance. A modern built-up gun is made up of a series of, let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
us say, four cylinders: the first, of comparatively small bore and
thickness, is innermost. It is cooled to as low a temperature as
possible, when a second cylinder is slipped over it red-hot to form
a tight fit. Both masses of metal are now slowly cooled, when a
third red-hot, closely fitting cylinder is passed over them. All
three united masses are now cooled, when the fourth and widest
cylinder of all, red-hot, is passed over these three inner tubes, and
the whole gun is allowed gradually to fall in temperature. When
this process is completed the inner parts of the gun, by virtue of
the shrinkage in the metal as it cooled, are under severe compression,
while the outer parts are in as extreme a state of stretch
or tension. When such a gun is fired its inner cylinders oppose
much greater resistance to the outward pressure of the exploding
gases than did the walls of the old-time guns. The strength of
the old guns was uniform throughout when they were doing
nothing, and very far from uniform at the instant of firing; a
built-up gun, on the contrary, has uniform strength in its every
part just when that uniformity is wanted, at the moment of explosion.
The built-up gun therefore uses projectiles vastly heavier
and swifter than those of former times. Its structure, made up
of cylinders successively shrunk one upon another, resembles
that of the heart, whose two inner parts have their fibres wound
somewhat like balls of twine, these in turn being tightly compressed
by a covering of other fibres. The heart has to resist no
such explosive force as arises within a gun, but in its propulsion
of blood through the arteries and veins it has to exert great pressure,
with no rest throughout a lifetime. This pressure is uniformly
distributed throughout the muscular tissue by a structure
which, as engineers would say, has its outer layers in tension and
its inner layers in compression. During twenty-four hours the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
labor of an average human heart is equal to lifting two hundred
and twenty tons one foot from the ground.</p>

<p>What building-up does to strengthen the gun has been repeated
in the case of the circular saw: driven at a high speed it
becomes so highly heated at its periphery that the resulting expansion
may crack the metal in pieces. In an improved method
of manufacture the saw is hammered to a compression which
gradually increases from rim to centre. In this way the tendency
of the periphery to fly apart is withstood by the compressive forces
at the central portion of the disc.</p>

<p>This ingenious treatment of metal for guns and saws reminds
us of a familiar resource in carpentry, <a href="#Fig42">illustrated</a> on page 36. An
ordinary book-shelf, if fairly long and not particularly stout,
bends beneath its burden and may at last slip out from its mortices
and fall with injury to its books. At the outset this is prevented
by bending the shelf to convexity on its upper surface. Then a
heavy load no more than brings the shelf to straightness, so that
the books remain in their places with both safety and sightliness.
Here a principle is involved worth a moment&#8217;s pause. An inventor
asks, What effect will a working load exert which it is
desirable to lessen or withstand? He gives his structure a form
opposite to that which will result from an imposed burden, so
that when at work his structure, a shelf, a cylinder, a saw, will
assume its most effective shape.</p>

<h3>The Eye and the Dollond Lenses.</h3>

<p>From childhood we are familiar with the triangular prisms of
glass which break a sunbeam into all the hues of the rainbow. A
lens is a prism of circular form, and has,
equally with an ordinary prism, the power to
show rays of all colors. This was for a long
time a source of error and annoyance in telescopic
images. Sir Isaac Newton from some rough and ready
experiments concluded that the trouble was beyond remedy, yet
all the while his own eyeballs were transmitting images with little
or no vexatious fringe of color. Let us note how Dollond set
about a task which Newton deemed impossible. He knew, what
Newton did not know, that crown glass disperses or scatters light
only half as much as does flint glass, so he united a lens of the
one to a lens of the other, and obtained a refracted or bent beam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
of light almost unchanged in its whiteness. Of course, in this
combination there was an increased thickness of glass, but its
doubled absorption and waste of light was a small drawback compared
with the advantage of almost wholly excluding the tinted
fringe which had so long vexed astronomers. In the eyeball are
first a crystalline lens, next an aqueous humor, third a vitreous
humor; these three so vary in their qualities of refraction and
dispersion as to render images quite free from color fringes.
Compound lenses on the Dollond principle, repeating the structure
of an eyeball, are used in all good telescopes, microscopes,
and cameras, and are now executed in varieties of Jena glass
which bring perturbing hues to the vanishing point. In their
achromatic, or color-free, lenses and their cameras, or dark chambers,
our photographic instruments much resemble the eye. Indeed,
it may be that when we see an object the impression is due
to a succession of fleeting photographs, following each other so
rapidly on the retina as to seem a permanent picture. The eye,
furthermore, is stereoscopic; by uniting two images seen from
slightly differing points of view, it enables us to judge of size,
solidity, and distance.</p>

<h3>Limbs and Lungs as Prototypes.</h3>

<p>Long before there was a philosopher to classify levers into
distinct kinds, the foot of man was affording examples of levers
of the first and second orders, and his fore-arm
of a lever of the third order. Ages before
the crudest bagpipe was put together, the
lungs by which they were to be blown, and the
larynx joined to those lungs, were displaying a wind instrument
of perfect model. The wrists, ankles, and vertebrae of Hooke
might well have served him in designing
his universal joint. Indeed
weapons, tools, instruments, machines,
and engines are, after all, but
extensions and modified copies of
the bodily organs of the inventor
himself.</p>

<p>Canals have called forth the ingenuity
of an army of engineers;
ever since the first heart-throb, the
circulation of the human blood was
exemplifying a system in which the
canal liquid and the canal boats move
together, making a complete circuit
twice in a minute, distributing supplies
wherever required, and taking
up without stopping return loads
wherever they are found ready. The
heart, with its arteries and veins,
forms a distributing apparatus which
carries heat from places at which it
is generated, or in excess, to places
where it is deficient, tending to establish a uniform, healthful temperature.
To copy all this, with the ventilating
appliances prefigured in the
lungs, is a task which in our huge
modern buildings demands the utmost
skill of the architect and engineer.</p>

<h3>Postal and Telephonic Service.</h3>

<p>In a great city each branch post office
is connected solely with headquarters, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
which it sends its letters, papers, and parcels, receiving in return
its batches for local distribution. For each branch office to communicate
with every other would be so costly
and cumbrous a plan as to be quite impracticable.
Our postal method is adopted in
every telephonic service; Z communicating with D or M only
after he has had his line joined to the central switchboard which
connects with every telephone in the whole system. All this was
prophesied in the remote ancestry of both postmasters and electricians
as their nerves took the paths of what is in effect a complete
telegraphic circuit, with separate up and down lines and a
central exchange in the brain,&mdash;that prototype of all other means
of co-ordination.</p>

<h3>Fibrils of the Ear and Eye.</h3>

<p>Pianos, organs, and other musical instruments yield their notes
by the vibration of strings, pipes, or reeds of definite size and
form. Across the larynx, the box-like organ
of the throat, the vocal cords vibrate in an
identical way. When we sing a note into an
open piano, the string capable of giving out
that note at once responds. Helmholtz believed that in the ear the
delicate, graduated structures, known as the rods of Corti, vibrate
in the same way when sound-waves reach them, giving rise to
auditory impressions. Analogous in operation are the fibrils of
the eye which respond to light-waves of various length and intensities.
The human eye has muscles which modify its globularity,
rendering its lenses more or less convex. A cat has a
higher degree of this kind of ability, so that it can dilate its pupil
so much as to see clearly in a feeble light. A man who remains in
a darkened room so rests his nerves of vision that in four or five
hours he can readily discern what would be unseen were he newly
brought into the darkness.</p>

<h3>The Electric Eel.</h3>

<p>Not only in the frame of man, but in the bodies of the lower
animals, are suggestions which ingenuity might well have acted
upon in the past, or worthily pursue in the
future. The science of electricity was born
only with the nineteenth century because the
gymnotus, or electric eel, had not been understandingly dissected.
Its tissues disclose the very arrangement adopted by Volta in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
first crude battery, namely, layers of susceptible material surrounded
by slightly acid moisture. The characteristics of this eel
have their homologies in the human body; in the muscles which
bend the fore-arm, for example, are nearly a million delicate
fibrils comparable in structure with the columnar organs of the
gymnotus. These fibrils are so easily excited by electricity as to
denote an essential similarity of build. Both the columnar layers
of the eel and the fibrils of human muscle are affected in the same
way by strychnine and by an allied substance, curare.</p>

<h3>A Beaver Tooth and the Self-Sharpening Plow.</h3>

<p>The frames of other animals furnish forth a goodly round of
analogies with recent products of mechanical ingenuity. A
beaver tooth might well have been the model
for a self-sharpening plowshare, widely used
throughout the world. This tooth has a thin
outer layer of hard enamel, within which,
dentine, less hard, makes up the rest of the structure. Gnawing
wears the dentine much more than the enamel, so that the tooth
takes on a bevel resembling that of the
chisel which pays frequent visits to a
carpenter&#8217;s oil-stone. The scale of
enamel gives keenness, the dentine ensures
strength, so that the tooth
sharpens itself by use, instead of
growing dull. Much the same structure
is repeated in a plowshare by
chilling the underskin of the steel to
extreme hardness, while the upper face of the share is left comparatively
soft. As it goes through the ground the upper face
wears away so as to yield a constantly sharpened edge of the thin
chilled under metal. Thus the heavy draft of a dull share is
avoided without constant recourse to the blacksmith for re-sharpening.</p>

<h3>Shaping a Tube.</h3>

<p>In another field of ingenuity a great inventor scored a success,
simply by deliberately taking a lesson from nature. James Watt,
to whom the modern steam engine is most indebted
for its excellence, was once consulted by
the proprietors of the Glasgow Water Works,
as to a difficulty that had occurred in laying pipes across the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Clyde to the Company&#8217;s engines: the bed of the river was covered
with mud and shifting sand, was full of inequalities, and subject
to a current at times of considerable force. With the structure of
a lobster&#8217;s tail in his mind,
Watt drew a plan for an
articulated suction-pipe, so
jointed as to accommodate
itself to the shifting curves
of the river-bed. This
crustacean tube, two feet in
diameter, and one thousand
feet in length, succeeded
perfectly in its operation.
To-day powerful hydraulic
dredges discharge through
piping with flexible joints
such as Watt devised; in
one instance this piping is
5700 feet in length.</p>

<p>In many another case art
has used a gift of nature
simply as received, and then
improved upon it. In making
their harpoons the Eskimo
used the spiral teeth
of the narwhal; finding their shape advantageous, they copied it
for arrowheads. This is undoubtedly one of the origins of the
screw form, of inestimable value to the mechanic and engineer.</p>

<h3>Lessons from Lower Animals: A Tool-Using Wasp.</h3>

<p>Savages turn birds and beasts to account as food, clothing, and
materials for weapons and tools; they also observe with profit the
instincts of these creatures. Le Vaillant, the
famous explorer, tells us that in Africa the
negroes eat any strange food they see the monkeys
devour, well assured that it will prove
wholesome. When the surveyors of the first transcontinental
railroad of America began their labors, they gave diligent heed
to the trails of buffaloes in the Rocky Mountains, believing that
these sagacious brutes in centuries of quest had discovered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
easiest passes. In constructive powers bees, ants and wasps far
outrank quadrupeds. Indeed one of the supreme feats of human
architecture, the dome, forms part of the nest of the warrior white
ant, <i>Termes bellicosus</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>It is deemed a mark of unusual intelligence when an ape, of
kin to man himself, uses a stone as a hammer wherewith to break
open a nut, and yet the like intelligence
is displayed by <i>Ammophila
urnaria</i>, as described
by Dr. and Mrs. George W.
Peckham in their charming
book, &#8220;Wasps Solitary and

<p>&#8220;Just here must be told the
story of one little wasp whose
individuality stands out in our
minds more distinctly than
that of any of the others. We
remember her as the most
fastidious and perfect little
worker of the whole season,
so nice was she in her adaptation of means to ends, so busy and
contented in her labor of love, and so pretty in her pride over the
completed work. In filling up her nest she put her head down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
into it and bit away the loose earth from the sides, letting it fall
to the bottom of her burrow, and then, after a quantity had accumulated,
jammed it down with her head. Earth was then
brought from the outside and pressed in, and then more was bitten
from the sides. When at last the filling was level with the
ground, she brought a quantity of fine grains of dirt to the spot,
and picking up a small pebble in her mandibles, used it as a
hammer in pounding them down with rapid strokes, thus making
this spot as hard and firm as the surrounding surface.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a wasp, too, which suggested to Reaumur, as he examined
its nest, that wood might well serve as the raw material for
paper, and serve it does to the amount of millions of tons a year.
To-day we have as a new fabric for garments, glanz-stoff, an
artificial silk produced from cellulose; its German manufacturers
have imitated as nearly as they could the silk-worm&#8217;s thread, just
as for some years the filaments for incandescent lamps have been
made from liquid cellulose forced through minute holes. At first
bamboo fibres were used for this purpose; to-day art furnishes
a thread of more uniform and lasting quality. This achievement
is of a piece with many another. To-day when an inventor seeks
to imitate a natural product he does so with a power of analysis,
a wealth of new materials, such as his forerunners could not have
imagined. It is in laboratories stocked more diversely than ever
before, with their resources better understood than at any earlier
time, that the triumphs of modern ingenuity proceed.</p>

<h3>The Separating Task of the Lungs.</h3>

<p>In all likelihood one of the feats of nature soon to be paralleled
by art, in an economical way, will be one phase of the breathing
process; every time we inflate our lungs their
tissues perform a feat which has thus far
baffled imitation except in a roundabout and
wasteful manner. Air is a mixture of oxygen
and nitrogen; the work of life is subserved by the oxygen only,
which is separated from air by the lungs and passed into the
current of the blood. Oxygen and nitrogen, like any other two
gases, tend forcibly to diffuse into each other, as we may see in
the distension of a thin rubber sheet dividing a container into
two parts, one filled with oxygen, the other with nitrogen. To
overcome the force of diffusion which keeps together the oxygen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
and nitrogen forming a cubic foot of air, of ordinary temperature,
would require such an effort as would lift twenty-one pounds
one foot from the ground. This task the lungs accomplish by
means which elude observation or analysis. It would mean much
to the arts if this parting power could be imitated simply and
cheaply. In common combustion each volume of oxygen which
unites with the fuel, carries with it four volumes of nitrogen
which have to be heated, not only reducing the temperature of the
flame, but removing in sheer waste much of the heat. A supply
of oxygen free from admixture would double the value of fuel
for many purposes, creating a temperature so high that it would
be difficult to find building materials refractory enough for the
furnaces. Cheap oxygen would greatly increase the light derivable
from oil and gas, as proved in the brilliancy of an oxyhydrogen
jet. In bleaching and in scores of other processes,
oxygen is so valuable that, notwithstanding its present cost, the
demand for it steadily increases. Cannot the lungs, chemically or
mechanically, be copied so as to yield this gas at a low price for a
thousand new services?</p>

<p>In addition to separating oxygen from air our vital organs are
every moment performing chemical tasks just as elusive. The
liver, for instance, is a sugar-maker. The elaboration of living
tissue is of transcendent interest to the physiologist; it is fraught
with the same attraction to the chemist who would build compounds
from their elements, to the engineer who would transform
heat or chemical energy into motive power with less than the
enormous loss of our present methods.</p>

<h3>Flight.</h3>

<p>In 1887 the late Professor S. P. Langley of Washington began
experiments in mechanical flight. He found that one horse-power
will support in calm air and propel at
forty-five miles an hour a wing-plane weighing
209 pounds. Dr. A. F. Zahm, of the Catholic
University of America, at Washington, has recently ascertained
that a thin foot-square gliding plane weighing one pound soars
with the least expenditure of power at about 40 miles an hour,
while at 80 miles the power required is more than twice as much.
As engines have been made weighing less than ten pounds per
horse-power, capable of yielding a horse-power for five hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
with four pounds of oil, we are plainly approaching the mastery
of the air,&mdash;so freely exercised by the sparrow and the midge.
Among the students eager in this advance are the men who
examine with the camera how wings of diverse types behave in
flight, and then endeavor to imitate the strongest and swiftest of
these wings.</p>

<h3>Light.</h3>

<p>Professor Langley conducted another inquiry of fascinating
interest, this time respecting those natural light-producers, the
fireflies, especially the large and brilliant
species indigenous to Cuba, <i>Pyrophorus noctilucus</i>.
As the result of refined measurements
with the spectroscope and the bolometer, the most delicate heat
detector known to the laboratory, he said: &#8220;The insect spectrum
is lacking in rays of red
luminosity and presumably in
the infra-red rays, usually of
relatively great heat, so that it
seems probable that we have here
light without heat.&#8221; When we
remember that ordinary artificial
light is usually accompanied by
fifty to a hundred times as much
energy in the form of wasteful and injurious heat, we see the
importance of this research. If light can be produced without
heat by nature, why not also by art?</p>

<h3>Converting Heat Into Work.</h3>

<p>Another notable case of efficiency in nature has already been
remarked, namely, the conversion by the animal frame of fuel-values
into mechanical work. This is of a
piece with the chief task of the engineer as he
puts his engines in motion by burning coal or
wood, oil or gas. It is a remarkably good
steam engine which yields as much as one tenth as a working dividend.
Gas engines have sprung into wide popularity because
they yield larger results, in extremely favorable cases reaching
thirty per cent. A heat engine, of any type, has its effectiveness
measured by comparing in absolute units the heat which enters it
with the heat which remains after its work is done. The zero of
the absolute scale is 460&deg; below the zero of Fahrenheit. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
that if an engine begins work at 920&deg; Fahr. (1380&deg; absolute), and
the working substance is lowered in temperature by its action in
the machine until it falls to 460&deg; Fahrenheit (920&deg; absolute), the
engine has a gross efficiency of one third. Economy depends
upon employing a working substance at the highest feasible temperature
in such a mode that it leaves the engine at the lowest
temperature possible. Hence we see engineers devising superheaters
for their steam, and producing metal surfaces which
either need no lubrication at all, or employ such a lubricant as
graphite, which bears high temperatures without injury.</p>

<p>Now let us glance at the mechanism of our own frames, which,
according to Professor W. O. Atwater, converts about twenty per
cent. of the energy value of our food into mechanical work. This
is a remarkable performance, especially when we remember that
in health the bodily warmth does not rise above 98&deg; Fahrenheit.
What explains this amazing effectiveness at a temperature so far
below that of either a steam engine or a gas engine? A simple
experiment may be illuminating. We take a plate of zinc and a
plate of copper; although they seem to be at rest we know them
to be in active molecular motion, which motion is set free when
they combine with oxygen or other elements. This combination
may take place in two quite different ways, which we will now
compare. In a glass jar, nearly filled with a solution of sulphuric
acid and water, we immerse the plates of zinc and copper without
their touching each other; both rise in temperature as they corrode,
as they unite with oxygen from the surrounding liquid. We
may, if we wish, employ this heat in driving an air engine; but
we can do better than that, for an air engine wastes most of the
heat supplied to it. We stop the heating process by joining the
two plates with a wire through which now passes an electric current,
our simple apparatus now forming a common voltaic cell.
This current we apply to lift weights, propel a fan, or execute
any other task we please, all with scarcely any waste of energy
whatever. The instructive point is that now chemical union is
taking place without heat, in a mode vastly more economical and
easy to manage than if we allowed heat to be generated, and then
applied it in an engine to perform work. The conclusion is irresistible:
in the animal frame the conversion of molecular energy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
into muscular motion is by electrical means and no other. When
the engineer learns in detail how the task is executed, and imitates
it with success; he will escape the tax now imposed on every
engine which sets its fuel on fire as the first step in converting
latent into actual motion.</p>

<h3>Foresight Instead of Hindsight.</h3>

<p>While inventors in the past might have taken many a hint from
nature, as a matter of fact they seldom did so, but went ahead,
hit-or-miss, failing to observe that what they
reached with much laborious fumbling, often
they might have copied directly from nature.
In Colorado and California we admire the dams which are convex
upstream, withstanding in all the strength of an arch a tremendous
pressure: this very plan is adopted by beavers when they
build in a swift current, as one may see in many streams of the
Adirondacks. In the rearing of irrigation dams, in tasks much
more difficult, human progress has gone forward by empirical
attempts one after another, and science has followed, long afterward,
to give reasons for any success arrived at by rule-of-thumb.
But this blundering hindsight is being replaced by a
foresight which first spies out what may be hit, and then never
wastes an arrow. Professor R. H. Thurston has said<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;Bleaching
and dyeing flourished before chemistry had a name; the inventor
of gunpowder lived before Lavoisier; the mariner&#8217;s compass
pointed the seaman to the pole before magnetism took form
as a science. The steam engine was invented and set at work,
substantially as we know it to-day, before the science of thermodynamics
was dreamt of; the telegraph and the telephone, the
electric light and the railroad have made us familiar with marvels
greater than those of fiction, and yet they have been principally
developed, in every instance, by men who had acquired less of
scientific knowledge than we demand to-day of every college-bred
lad.&#8221;</p>

<p>To-day the leaders in applied science are of quite other stamp.
They keenly observe what nature does, either in spontaneous
chemical activities or in the functions of a plant or an animal,
then analyzing the process with more and more insight and accuracy,
they ask, How may this with economy and profit be
imitated by art? A feat of Professor Henri Moissan is typical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
in this regard. In studying diamonds he became convinced that
they have been produced in nature from ordinary carbon subjected
to extreme temperatures and pressures. Imitating these
heats and pressures as well as he could, he manufactured diamonds
from common graphite in an electrical furnace. These
gems are small, but they gleam with promise of what the fully
armed physicist and chemist may achieve in duplicating the gifts
of nature in the light of new knowledge, by dint of new resources.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />
ORIGINAL RESEARCH</h2>

<p class="chaptoc">Knowledge as sought by disinterested inquirers .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A plenteous harvest
with but few reapers .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Germany leads in original research .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
Carnegie Institution at Washington.</p>

<p class="chapstart">We have now taken a rapid survey of invention and discovery
in the fields of Form, Size, Properties, Measurement, and
the Teachings of Nature. We will here somewhat change our
point of view and bestow a glance at the characteristics of inventors
and discoverers, noting their powers of observation and
experiment, their patience from first to last in learning from other
thinkers and workers past and present. What any one man, however
able, can discover or invent, is the merest trifle in comparison
with the resources accumulated since the dawn of human
wit. And yet in adding a little to what he has learned, that little
welds and vivifies his education as nothing else can. In setting
out to add to known truth there must be a goodly equipment in
knowledge and skill. Knowledge, therefore, may serve as a starting
point for the survey before us.</p>

<h3>Knowledge Necessary.</h3>

<p>Success in discovery and invention, as in the case of a Newton
or a Watt, depends not only upon rare natural faculty, but upon
knowledge. Dr. Pye-Smith, of London, an
eminent physician, says<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;Some would have
us believe that erudition is a clog upon genius.
This question has often been discussed, and it has even been
maintained that he is most likely to search out the secrets of nature
who comes fresh to the task with faculties unexhausted by
prolonged reading, and his judgment uninfluenced by the discoveries
of others. This, however, is surely a delusion. Harvey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
could not have discovered the circulation of the blood had he not
been taught all that had been previously learned of anatomy.
True, no progress can be made by the mere assimilation of
previous knowledge. There must be an intelligent curiosity, an
observant eye, and intellectual insight. Few things are more deplorable
than to see talent and industry employed in fruitless
researches, partly rediscovering what is already fully known, or
stubbornly toiling along a road which has long ago been found
to lead no whither. We must then instruct our students to the
utmost of our power. Whether they will add to knowledge we
cannot tell, but at least they shall not hinder its growth by their
ignorance. The strong intellect will absorb and digest all that
we put before it, and will be all the better fitted for independent
research. The less powerful will at least be kept from false discoveries
and will form, what genius itself requires, a competent
and appreciative audience.&#8221;</p>

<p>American inventors echo the dictum of the English physician.
Says Mr. Octave Chanute<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;It has taken many men to bring any
great invention to perfection, the last successful man adding little
to what was previously known. As a rule the basis of his success
lies in a thorough acquaintance with what has been done before
him, and his setting about his work in a thoroughly scientific way.&#8221;
Professor W. A. Anthony observes<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;If the army of would-be
inventors would enter the field with a full knowledge of what
science has already done, the conquest of new territory would be
rapidly accomplished.&#8221; To the same effect speaks Mr. Leicester
Allen<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;While rarely there appears a man so highly endowed by
nature with originating faculty that we call his talent genius, it
will be found in the last analysis that his inventive power lies,
not in some vague, mysterious intuition, but in a logical mind that
can draw correct inferences from established premises; in an
analytical mind that enables him to reason from correct data, discovering
those which are false; in natural and cultivated perceptive
faculties that enable him to determine the effect of a given
set of conditions, and through exercise of which he is able to place
clearly before his mental vision the exact statement or proposition
which defines the thing to be accomplished; in the ability to concentrate
his attention upon the problem in hand to the exclusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
of everything else, for the time being, and a perseverance that will
not be denied&mdash;that failure cannot wear out.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Much is Still to be Discovered.</h3>

<p>&#8220;To many,&#8221; says Sir Michael Foster, Professor of Physiology
at Cambridge, &#8220;scientific knowledge seems to be advancing by
leaps and bounds; every day brings its fresh
discovery, opening up strange views, turning
old ideas upside down. Yet every thoughtful
man of science who has looked round on what
others beside himself are doing will tell you that nothing weighs
more heavily on his mind than this: the multitude of questions
crying aloud to be answered, the fewness of those who have at
once the ability, the means, and the opportunity of attempting to
find the answers. Among the many wants of a needy age, few, if
any, seem to him more pressing than that of the adequate encouragement
and support of scientific research.&#8221; With his own
field of science in view he continues: &#8220;We want to know more
about the causation and spread of disease and about the circumstances
affecting health before we can legislate with certainty of
success. At home we want to know more about the spread of
tubercle, of typhoid fever, and other infectious diseases; we want
to know more about the proper means to secure that the water we
drink, the food we eat, and the air we breathe, should not be
channels of disease; we want to know more about the invisible
elfic micro-organisms which swarm around us, to learn which are
our friends, and which our foes, how to nourish the one, how to
defeat the other; we want to know the best way to shield man in
the factory and the workshop against the works of man.&#8221;</p>

<p>As to the fewness of those who have the highest capacity for
original research, who have it in them to add to known truth in a
notable way, Professor Simon Newcomb of Washington, the
acknowledged dean of science in America, has said<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;It is impressive
to think how few men we should have to remove from
the earth during the past three centuries to have stopped the advance
of our civilization. In the seventeenth century there would
only have been Galileo, Newton and a few other contemporaries;
in the eighteenth, they could almost have been counted on the
fingers; and they have not crowded the nineteenth. Even to-day,
almost every great institution for scientific research owes its being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
to some one man, who, as its founder or regenerator, breathed into
it the breath of life. If we think of the human personality as
comprehending not merely mind and body, but all that the brain
has set in motion, then may the Greenwich Observatory of to-day
be called Airy; that of Pulkowa, Struve; the German Reichsanstalt,
Helmholtz; the Smithsonian Institution, Henry; the Harvard
Museum of Comparative Zo&ouml;logy, Agassiz; the Harvard
Observatory, Pickering.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Planning an Inquiry.</h3>

<p>The late Professor Robert H. Thurston, of Cornell University,
once said<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;Methods of planning scientific investigation involve,
first, the precise definition of the problem to be
solved; secondly, they include the ascertainment
of &#8216;the state of the art,&#8217; as the engineer
would say, the revision of earlier work in the same and related
fields, and the endeavor to bring all available knowledge into relation
with the particular case in hand; then the investigator seeks
information which will permit him, if possible, to frame some
theory or hypothesis regarding the system into which he proposes
to carry his experiment, his studies, and his logical work, such as
will serve him as a guide in directing his work most effectively.</p>

<p>&#8220;The empirical, the imaginative, and even the guess work systems,
or perhaps lack of system, have their place in scientific research.
The dim Titanic figure of Copernicus seems to rear itself
out of the dull flats around it, pierces with its head the mists that
overshadow them and catches the first glimpse of the rising sun.
But first Copernicus made a shrewd guess, and then followed with
mathematical work and confirmation. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Kepler, also, was
strong almost beyond competition in speculative subtlety and
innate mathematical perception. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For nineteen years he
guessed at the solution of a well-defined problem, finding his
speculation wrong every time, until at last a final trial of a last
hypothesis gave rise to deductions confirmed by observation. His
first guess was that the orbits of the planets were circular, next
that they were oval, and last that they were elliptical.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pascal, great in what he knew, was great also in what he was.
Walter Pater thus depicts his powers<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;Hidden under the apparent
exactions of his favorite studies, imagination, even in them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
played a large part. Physics, mathematics, were with him largely
matters of intuition, anticipation, precocious discovery, short cuts,
superb guessing. It was the inventive element in his work, and
his way of painting things that surprised those most able to judge.
He might have discovered the mathematical sciences for himself,
it is alleged, had his father, as he once had a mind to do, withheld
him from instruction in them.&#8221;</p>

<p>No such gift of intuition as that displayed by Pascal fell to
the lot of Buffon, who tells us<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;Invention depends on patience.
Contemplate your subject long. It will gradually unfold itself,
till an electric spark convulses the brain for a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>As to the modes in which invention manifests itself, Mr. William
H. Smyth says<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;Examine at random any one of half a
dozen lines of mechanical invention, one characteristic common
to them all will instantly arrest attention&mdash;they present nothing
more than a mere outgrowth of the manual processes and machines
of earlier times. Some operation, once performed by
hand tools, is expedited by a device which enables the foot as well
as the hand to be employed. Then power is applied; the hand or
foot operation, or both, are made automatic, and possibly, as a
still further improvement, several of these automatic devices are
combined into one. All the while the fundamental basis is the
old, original hand process; hence, except in the extremely improbable
event that this was the best possible method, all the successive
improvements are simply in the direction, not of real novelty, but
of mere modification and multiplication. The most important and
radical departures from old methods, by which many of the industries
of the world have been completely revolutionized, are
nearly always originated by persons wholly ignorant of the accepted
practice in the particular industry concerned. The first
and most important prerequisite to invention is an absolutely
clear insight into, and a comprehensive grasp of, all the conditions
involved in the problem. A scheme for the cultivation of
invention should in part include<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>(1) Accurate and methodical
observation. (2) Cultivation of memory and the faculty of association.
(3) Cultivation of clear visualization. (4) Logical
reasoning from actual observation. The course should include<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
exercises in drawing from simple objects, and the solution of a
simple problem, such as that of a can-soldering machine.&#8221;</p>

<h3>The Debt to Research in Medicine.</h3>

<p>Investigators are never so useful as when thoroughly disinterested;
let them find what they may, it will either have worth
in itself or lead to something which has. Dr.
Pye-Smith says<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Facts have been found at every step of
science which were valueless at their discovery,
but which, little by little, fell into line and led to applications
of the highest importance&mdash;the observation of the tarnishing
of silver, the twitching of the frog&#8217;s leg, were the origin of
photography and telegraphy; the abstract problem of spontaneous
generation gave rise to the antiseptics of surgery. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In
medicine, as in every other practical art, progress depends upon
knowledge, and knowledge must be pursued for its own sake
without continually looking about for its practical applications.
Harvey&#8217;s great discovery of the circulation of the blood was a
strictly physiological discovery, and had little influence upon the
healing art until the invention of auscultation. So, also, Dubois
Reymond&#8217;s investigation of the electrical properties of muscle
and nerve was purely scientific, but we use the results thus obtained
every day in the diagnosis of disease, in its successful
treatment, and in the scarcely less important demonstration of
the falsehoods by which the name of electricity is used for purposes
of gain. The experiments on blood pressure, begun by
Hales, and carried to a successful issue in our own time by Ludwig,
have already led to knowledge which we use every day
by the bedside, and which only needs the discovery of a better
method of measuring blood pressure during life to become one of
our foremost and most practical aids in treatment. Again, we
can most of us remember using very imperfect physiological
knowledge to fix, more or less successfully, the locality of an
organic lesion of the brain. I also remember such attempts being
described as a mere scientific game, which could only be won after
the player was beaten, since when the accuracy of diagnosis was
established, its object was already lost; but who would say this
now, when purely physiological research and purely diagnostic
success have led to one of the most brilliant achievements of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
practical medicine, the operative treatment of organic diseases of
the brain?&#8221;</p>

<p>The prevention of disease, as important as its cure, owes an
incalculable debt to Louis Pasteur. De Varigny says in &#8220;Experimental
Evolution&#8221;<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Pasteur, about 1850, spent a long time in seemingly very
speculative and very idle studies of dissymmetry and symmetry
in various crystals, especially those of tartaric acid; the practical
value of such investigations seemed to be naught, and at all events
it had no interest save for the elucidation of some points in crystallography.
But this investigation led logically to the study of
fermentation, and the final outcome of Pasteur&#8217;s work has been&mdash;leaving
out the stepping stones&mdash;the discovery of the real cause
of a large number of diseases, the cure of one of them, and the
expectation, based on facts, that all these diseases can be defeated
by appropriate methods.&#8221;</p>

<p>What is true in medicine is equally true in physics. Concerning
the debt of the inventor to the man of physical research, Mr.
Addison Browne has this to say<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<h3>Research in Physics and Chemistry.</h3>

<p>&#8220;A few weeks ago I was talking with an
electrician who has made several very interesting
and important inventions. I asked him of
how much importance he conceived that the scientific men of the
closet, the original investigators, so-called, had been in working
out the great inventions of electricity during the last fifty years&mdash;telegraphs,
cables, telephones, electric lighting, electric motors;
and whether these achievements were not in reality due mainly
to practical men, the inventors who knew what they were after,
rather than to the men of science who rarely applied their work
to practical use. He said, &#8216;The scientific men are of the utmost
importance; everything that has been done has proceeded upon
the basis of what they have previously discovered, and upon the
principles and laws which they have laid down. Nowadays we
never work at random&mdash;I go to my laboratory, study the application
of the principles, facts and laws which the great scientists
like Faraday, Thomson and Maxwell have worked out, and endeavor
to find such devices as shall secure my aim.&#8217; As Tyndall
said, &#8216;Behind all our practical applications there is a region of intellectual<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
action to which practical men have rarely contributed, but
from which they draw all their supplies. Cut them off from that
region and they become eventually helpless.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Research is golden only when brought to fruit by co-operation.
To quote Professor Tyndall<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;To keep science in healthy play three classes of workers are
necessary: (1) The investigators of natural truth, whose vocation
it is to pursue that truth, and extent the field of discovery for
its own sake, without reference to practical ends. (2) The
teachers who diffuse this knowledge. (3) The appliers of these
principles and truths to make them available to the needs, the
comforts, or the luxuries, of life. These three classes ought to co-exist
and interact.&#8221;</p>

<p>Concerning the larger problems of engineering research, Professor
Osborne Reynolds, of Owens College, Manchester, says<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Every one who has paid attention to the history of mechanical
progress must have been impressed by the smallness in number
of recorded attempts to decide the broader questions in engineering
by systematic experiments, as well as by the great results which,
in the long run, have apparently followed as the effect of these
few researches. I say &#8216;apparently,&#8217; because it is certain that there
have been other researches which probably, on account of failure
to attain some immediate object, have not been recorded, although
they may have yielded valuable experience which, though not put
on record, has, before it was forgotten, led to other attempts. But
even discounting such lost researches it is very evident that
mechanical science was in the past very much hampered by the
want of sufficient inducement to the undertaking of experiments
to settle questions of the utmost importance to scientific advance,
but which have not promised pecuniary results, scientific questions
which involved a greater sacrifice of time and money than the
individuals could afford. The mechanical engineers recently induced
Mr. Beauchamp Towers to carry out his celebrated researches
on the friction of lubricated journals, the results of
which research certainly claim notice as one of the most important
steps in mechanical science.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Rayleigh has said<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The present development of electricity on a large scale depends<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
as much upon the incandescent lamp as the dynamo. The
success of these lamps demands a very perfect vacuum&mdash;not more
than one millionth of the normal quantity of air should remain.
It is interesting to recall that in 1865 such vacua were rare even
in the laboratory of the physicist. It is pretty safe to say that
these wonderful results would never have been accomplished had
practical applications alone been in view. The way was prepared
by an army of men whose main object was the advancement
of knowledge, and who could scarcely have imagined that the
processes which they had elaborated would soon be in use on a
commercial scale and entrusted to the hands of ordinary workmen.&#8221;
He adds<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;The requirements of practice react in the
most healthy manner upon scientific electricity. Just as in former
days the science received a stimulus from the application to
telegraphy, under which everything relating to measurement on a
small scale acquired an importance and development for which
we might otherwise have had long to wait, so now the requirements
of electric lighting are giving rise to a new development of
the art of measurement on a large scale, which cannot fail to
prove of scientific as well as practical importance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Regarding the territory likely to yield most fruit to the researcher,
he observes<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;The neglected border land between two
branches of knowledge is often that which best repays cultivation;
or, to use a metaphor of Maxwell&#8217;s, the greatest benefits
may be derived from a cross-fertilization of the sciences.&#8221;</p>

<h3>The Example of Germany.</h3>

<p>Why Germany leads the world in science becomes clear when
we observe her co-ordination of industry with the higher education
and with original research. Professor Wilhelm
Ostwald has said<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;When the student in
Germany has finished his university course he is
still entirely free to choose between a scientific
and a technical career. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The occupation of a technical
chemist in works is very often almost as scientific in its character
as in a university laboratory. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The organization of the
power of invention in manufactures on a large scale in Germany
is, as far as I know, unique in the world&#8217;s history, and is the very
marrow of our splendid triumphs. Each large works has the
greater part of its scientific staff&mdash;and there are often more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
a hundred doctors of philosophy in a single manufactory&mdash;occupied
not in the management of the manufacture, but in making
inventions. The research laboratory in such works is only different
from one in a university from its being more splendidly
and sumptuously fitted. I have heard from the business managers
of such works that they have not infrequently men who have
worked for four years without practical success; but if they have
known them to possess ability they keep them notwithstanding,
and in most cases with ultimate success sufficient to pay all expenses.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Mr. Carnegie&#8217;s Aid to Original Research.</h3>

<p>In 1902 Mr. Andrew Carnegie, with a gift of ten million dollars,
founded in Washington the Carnegie Institution for Original
Research. Its president is Dr. R. S. Woodward,
formerly of Columbia University, New
York. One of its first enterprises was to establish
at Cold Spring Harbor, New York, a
station for experimental evolution directed by
Dr. Charles B. Davenport. Here will be extended the remarkable
experiments of Dr. Hugo de Vries, of Amsterdam, who discovered
that the large-flowered evening primrose suddenly gives
rise to new species. Other experiments are in progress with
regard to the variability of insects, the hybridization of plants
and animals. A marine biological laboratory has been established
at Tortugas, Florida; and a desert botanical laboratory at Tucson,
Arizona. In its grants for widely varied purposes the policy of
the Institution is clear: only those inquiries are aided which give
promise of fruit, and in every case the grantee requires to be
a man of proved ability, care being taken not to duplicate work
already in hand elsewhere, or to essay tasks of an industrial
character. Experience has already shown it better to confine
research to a few large projects rather than to aid many minor
investigations with grants comparatively small.</p>

<div class="figc450" id="Fig205">
<img src="images/illo321.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="580" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Dr. R. S. WOODWARD,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">President, Carnegie Institution, Washington, D. C.</span></p>
</div>

<p>One branch of the work reminds us of Mr. Carnegie&#8217;s method
in establishing public libraries&mdash;the supplementing of local public
spirit by a generous gift. In many cases a university or an observatory
launches an inquiry which soon broadens out beyond
the range of its own small funds; then it is that aid from the Carnegie
Institution brings to port a ship that otherwise might remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
at sea indefinitely. Let a few typical examples of this kind
be mentioned<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>Dudley Observatory, Albany, New York, and
Lick Observatory, California, have received aid toward their observations
and computations; Yerkes Observatory, Wisconsin, has
been helped in measuring the distances of the fixed stars. Among
other investigations promoted have been the study of the rare
earths and the heat-treatment of some high-carbon steels. The
adjacent field of engineering has not been neglected: funds have
been granted for experiments on ship resistance and propulsion,
for determining the value of high pressure steam in locomotive
service. In geology an investigation of fundamental principles
has been furthered, as also the specific problem of the flow of
rocks under severe pressure. In his remarkable inquiry into the
economy of foods, Professor W. O. Atwater, of Wesleyan University,
Middletown, Connecticut, has had liberal help. In the
allied science of preventive medicine a grant is advancing the
study of snake venoms and defeating inoculations.</p>

<p>At a later day the Institution may possibly adopt plans recommended
by eminent advisers of the rank of Professor Simon
Newcomb, who points out that analysis and generalization are
to-day much more needed than further observations of a routine
kind. He has also had a weighty word to say regarding the desirability
of bringing together for mutual attrition and discussion
men in contiguous fields of work, who take the bearings of a
great problem from different points of view.</p>

<p>Speaking of the study of human life and society, Professor
Karl Pearson is clear that both thorough training as well as sound
theories are needed if research is to be fruitful. In the course of
a letter to the Carnegie Institution, he says<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;Biological and
sociological observations in too many cases are of the lowest grade
of value. Even where the observers have begun to realize that
exact science is creeping into the biological and sociological fields
they have not understood that a thorough training in the new
methods is an essential preliminary for effective work, even for
the collection of material. They have rushed to measure or count
every living form they could hit on, without having planned at
the start the conceptions and ideas that their observations were
intended to illustrate. I doubt whether even a small proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
of the biometric data being accumulated in Europe and America
could by any amount of ingenuity be made to provide valuable
results, and the man capable of making it yield them would be
better employed in collecting and reducing his own material.&#8221;</p>

<p>Professor Edward C. Pickering, Director of the Harvard Observatory,
has suggested that astronomers the world over resolve
themselves into a committee of the whole for the attack of great
questions, the work to be duly parcelled out among the observatories
best placed and equipped for specific tasks, to the end that
repetition be avoided and a single, comprehensive plan be pursued.
Not only in astronomy but in every field of science such
concerted attack would have great value. In engineering, for
example, there are questions as to the durability of steels and other
building materials, which when investigated would yield rich
harvests to every practicing engineer on the globe. It may be expected
that in effecting co-ordinations of this kind the Carnegie
Institution will play a notable part in the science of the twentieth

<p class="chapstart">Ability to observe is an unfailing mark of an inventor or
discoverer: it is quite as much a matter of the mind as of
the eye. A botanist, keenly alive to varieties of hue, of form in
leaves, tendrils, and petals may not give a second glance to
stratifications which rivet the gaze of a geologist for hours together.
Each sees what he knows about, what he is interested in,
what he brings the power and desire to see. When Faraday was
asked to witness an experiment he always said: &#8220;What is it that
I am to look for?&#8221; He knew the importance of concentrating his
attention on the very bull&#8217;s eye of a target.</p>

<p>How much goes to sound observing is thus stated by John
Stuart Mill,&mdash;&#8220;The observer is not he who merely sees the thing
which is before his eyes, but he who sees what parts the thing is
composed of. One person, from inattention, or attending only in
the wrong place, overlooks half of what he sees; another sets
down much more than he sees, confounding it with what he
imagines, or with what he infers; another takes note of the <i>kind</i>
of all the circumstances, but being inexpert in estimating their
degree, leaves the quantity of each vague and uncertain; another
sees indeed the whole, but makes such an awkward division of it
into parts, throwing into one mass things which require to be
separated, and separating others which might more conveniently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
be considered as one, that the result is much the same, sometimes
even worse than if no analysis had been attempted at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>How an explorer of ability may witness a new fact without
realizing that it points to a great industry, is shown in the case
of Lord Dundonald. In 1782, or thereabout, near Culross Abbey
in Scotland, he built a tar-kiln. Noticing the inflammable nature
of a vapor arising during the distillation of tar, the Earl, by
way of experiment, fitted a gun-barrel to the eduction pipe leading
from the condenser. On applying fire to the muzzle, a vivid
light blazed forth across the waters of the Frith, distinctly visible
on the opposite shore. Soon afterward the inventor visited James
Watt at Handsworth, near Birmingham, and told him about the
gas-lighting at the kiln, but his host paid no attention to the
matter. His assistant, William Murdock, however, was impressed
by the story, and some years later applied gas to the illumination
of the Soho works where Watt&#8217;s engines were built. This was
the beginning of gas-lighting as a practical business.</p>

<p>Professor Adam Sedgwick, of Cambridge University, famous
as a geologist, and Charles Darwin once took an excursion in
Wales amid markings of extraordinary interest which neither of
them noticed. Darwin tells us: &#8220;I had a striking instance of how
easy it is to overlook phenomena, however conspicuous, before they
have been observed by any one. We spent many hours at Cwm
Idwal, examining the rocks with extreme care, as Sedgwick was
anxious to find fossils in them, but neither of us saw a trace of
the wonderful glacial phenomena all around us; we did not notice
the plainly scored rocks, the perched boulders, the lateral and
terminal moraines, yet these phenomena are so conspicuous that,
as I declared in a paper published many years afterward, a house
burnt down by fire could not tell its story more plainly than did
this valley. If it had been filled with a glacier, the phenomena
would have been less distinct than they now are.&#8221; At a later day
when Darwin&#8217;s powers of observation had become acute in the
highest degree, he noticed a bird&#8217;s feet covered with dirt. Rather
a common fact, not worth dwelling on, earlier observers had supposed.
Not so thought Darwin. He carefully washed the bird&#8217;s
feet, and planting the removed solids he was rewarded with several
strange plants brought from afar by his winged visitor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>A cousin to Charles Darwin, Francis Galton, is an investigator
of eminence. In a study of visual memory, a faculty in which
observation bears its best fruits, he says<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;It is a mistake to suppose that sharp sight is accompanied by
clear visual memory. I have not a few instances in which the independence
of the two faculties is emphatically commented upon;
and I have at least one clear case where great interest in outlines
and accurate apprehension of straightness, squareness, and the
like, is unaccompanied by the power of visualizing.&#8221;</p>

<p>A new instrument, machine or engine is imagined by its creator
long before it takes actual form; everything he sees that will be of
help he builds at once into his design, everything else, however
interesting in itself, he passes with a heedless eye.</p>

<h3>Think Birds and You Shall See Birds.</h3>

<p>&#8220;If we think birds, we shall see birds wherever we go,&#8221; says
John Burroughs. An observer faithful and accurate in noticing
birds and beasts, rocks and leaves, may come at
last upon a flower which opens a sphere of
knowledge wholly new, as when the round-leaved
sun-dew was first observed to entrap
and feed upon insects. Much, also, depends
upon comparisons such as occur only to a mind at once broad and
alert. One may notice in spring and early summer a few leaves
growing directly from the trunk of a tree, sometimes near the
ground. In maples these leaves are decidedly narrower than those
growing from branches in the usual way, and they often have a
reddish tinge. Comparing a variety of such leaves with fossil
impressions of allied species, Professor Robert T. Jackson of
Boston came upon an interesting discovery. He found that these
sporadic leaves closely resemble those borne by the remote ancestors
of our present trees: they are the lingering reminders of a
far distant day.</p>

<p>An observation equally keen saved the orange groves of California
from destruction by the fluted scale insect. In 1890, or
thereabout, the orange growers in their extremity sought the advice
of Professor C. V. Riley, entomologist to the Department of
Agriculture at Washington. He asked: &#8220;Where did the pest
come from?&#8221; &#8220;Australia,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;Is it much of a
nuisance there?&#8221; &#8220;Not particularly.&#8221; &#8220;Then what keeps it<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
down, what preys upon it?&#8221; &#8220;Nothing specially,&#8221; was the response.
Dissatisfied with this answer, Professor Riley sent to
Australia a trained entomologist and acute observer, Mr. Albert
Koebele, who gathered various insects noticed as preying upon
the fluted scale. Distributing these upon his arrival in California
he was fortunate enough to find that one of his assisted emigrants,
a lady bird, <i>Vedalia cardinalis</i>, fed so ravenously upon
the fluted scale as to restrict its ravages to quite moderate
proportions.</p>

<p>It was an equally disciplined eye which in the laboratory first
noticed that air is non-conducting until traversed by an X-ray,
when it becomes conducting in a noteworthy degree. The field
of radio-activity, at which we have glanced in this book, owes its
cultivation to observers keen to note phenomena utterly unlike
those before dwelt upon by the human eye. Often close observers
learn what would never be imagined as possible: in rifle-making
the tendency of the drills, which revolve nearly a thousand
times a minute, to follow the axial line in a revolving bar
is a fact which may be accounted for after observation, but which
no one would predict.</p>

<p>One day on the Glasgow and Ardrossan Canal a spirited horse
took fright; it was then observed, with astonishment, that a boat,
the &#8220;Raith,&#8221; to which it was attached, for all its increased speed,
went through the water with less resistance than before. The
vessel rode on the summit of a wave of its own creation with this
extraordinary effect. The &#8220;Raith,&#8221; said Mr. Scott Russell,
&#8220;weighed 10,239 pounds, requiring a force of 112 pounds to drag
it at 4.72 miles an hour; 275 pounds at 6.19 miles an hour, and
but 268<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> pounds at 10.48 miles per hour.&#8221; Thus paradoxically
was reversed the rule that the resistance of a vessel increases
rapidly as she is moved through the water. Mr. Russell added<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;Some
time since a large canal in England was closed against
general trade by want of water, drought having reduced the
depth from 12 to 5 feet. It was then found that the motion of
the light boats was more easy than before; the cause was obvious.
The velocity of the wave was so much reduced by the diminished
depth, that, instead of remaining behind the wave, the vessels
rode on its summit.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<h3>The Mississippi Jetties of James B. Eads.</h3>

<p>One of the most difficult problems ever solved by an American
engineer was the making navigation safe for vessels of fairly
deep draft in the lower branches of the Mississippi.
The difficulties were overcome by
James B. Eads, of St. Louis, in his system of
jetties. He remarked, says his biographer,
Mr. Louis How, that other things being equal, the amount of
sediment which a river can carry is in direct proportion to its
velocity. When, for any reason, the current becomes slower at
any special place, it drops part of its burden of sediment at that
place, and when it becomes faster again it picks up more. Now,
one thing that makes a river slower is an increase of its width,
because then there is more frictional surface; and contrariwise,
one of the things that makes it faster is a decrease of its width.
Narrow the Mississippi then, at its mouth, said Eads, and it will
become swifter there, and consequently will remove its soft bottom
by picking up the sediment (of which it will then hold much
more), and by carrying it out to the gulf, to be lost in deep water
and swept away by currents, you will have your deep channel.
In other words, if you give the river some assistance by keeping
its current together, it will do all the necessary labor and scour
out its own bottom. This sound reasoning, based upon observation
as sound, was duly embodied in a series of jetties which have
proved successful.</p>

<h3>Observation Suggests an Experiment.</h3>

<p>Such a river as the Mississippi taking its source through an
alluvial plain, has bends which go on increasing by the wearing
away of the outer banks, and the deposition of
mud, sand and gravel on the inner bank. In
1876 at the Glasgow meeting of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science,
Professor James Thomson showed a model which made the
phenomena of the case perfectly clear. A stream eight inches
wide and less than two inches deep, flowed round a bend. As it
turned this bend the water exerted centrifugal force, while a thin
layer of the water at the bottom, representing a similar layer close
to a river-bed, was retarded by its friction with the remainder of
the stream, exerting less centrifugal force than like portions of
the larger body of water flowing over it farther away from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
bottom. Consequently the bottom layer flowed in obliquely
across the channel toward the inner bank; rising up in its retarded
motion betwixt the fast flowing water it protected the inner bank
from scour. At the same time this retarded current brought with
it sand and other detritus from the bottom, duly deposited along
the inner bank of the stream.</p>

<h3>Instrumental Aids to Observation.</h3>

<p>The powers of the eye, acute as they are, have narrow limits;
inestimable therefore is the value of the microscope, the telescope
and the camera which bring to view uncounted
images otherwise unseen. Let us remark how
in the early days of instrumental aids a great
observer just missed noting a phenomenon of
utmost importance,&mdash;the black lines of the solar spectrum, upon
which Fraunhofer, an optician of Munich, based his spectroscope.
In sending a solar beam through a lens and a prism Sir Isaac
Newton admitted the rays through an oblong slit at times as
narrow as one twentieth of an inch. He saw the familiar colors,
from red to violet, and nothing more. Even with a crown lens,
such as he probably used, four lines distinctly appear; that is, they
appear to-day, to an observer who is looking for them. In 1802
these lines were observed, as far as we know, for the first time
on record, by Dr. Wollaston, who drew six of them in a diagram
accompanying a paper in the Philosophical Transactions. Four
of these lines he regarded as boundaries of the colors of the
spectrum; of the other two lines he attempted no explanation.
He used prisms of various materials but found no alteration in
the lines while he studied a sunbeam. When he employed candles
or an electric light he found the appearances different, why, he
could not undertake to explain. In 1814, Fraunhofer observed
these lines in detail, mapped them, and proved that they identified
elements long known to chemists. As he built his spectroscope he
gave the chemist, the physicist and the astronomer an instrument
of research worthy a place beside either the microscope or the
telescope.</p>

<p>Dr. Wollaston, in 1802, as we have seen stood upon the
threshold of spectroscopy without knowing it. During the same
year he performed an experiment which took him into the field
of photography without his recognizing the possibilities of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
wonderful art. He took paper which had been dipped in muriate
of silver and caught on its surface impressions of the ultra-violet
light in a solar spectrum. These rays, as rings, were reflected
from a thin plate of air, as in the case of the colors of thin plates,
at distances corresponding to their proper places in the spectrum.
Thus was established the close analogy between rays visible and
invisible, and by a method destined to give mankind a universal
limner in light of all kinds, and in much radiance which is not
luminous at all.</p>

<h3>Two Observers of the Skies.</h3>

<p>Edward Emerson Barnard, of the Yerkes Observatory, Williams
Bay, Wisconsin, is in the first rank of living astronomers.
Among his many discoveries the most remarkable
is that of the fifth satellite of Jupiter at
the Lick Observatory. His early work at the
Vanderbilt Observatory, Nashville, gave full
promise of his later achievements. One evening in November,
1883, he was observing an occultation of the well-known star
<i>Beta Capricorni</i> by the moon. He had patiently waited for his
opportunity; such an occultation is best seen when the moon is
a small crescent, the star disappearing at the dark curve of the
moon where its beams do not overpower the feeble stellar ray.
When the moon passes between the eye and a fixed star, the disappearance
of the star is instantaneous. At the distance from
which we look at it the star is a point only, and as the moon has
no atmosphere, the instant the edge of the lunar surface touches
the line joining the eye of the observer with the star, it vanishes
from sight. When the moon passed in front of <i>Beta Capricorni</i>
Mr. Barnard noticed that instead of disappearing at once, there
was a sudden partial diminution of the light of the star, then a
total extinction of the remaining point. The interval between
the diminution and complete extinction of the light occupied only
a few tenths of a second, but it was long enough to put his keen
mind upon inquiry. Mr. Barnard in an astronomical journal
called attention to the phenomenon and suggested that instead of
there being only one star, as formerly supposed, there were really
two stars so close together that in an ordinary six-inch telescope,
such as he had used, they appeared to be one. He inferred also
that one of the pair must be a good deal brighter than the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
because at the beginning the change in brightness was less than
at the end. This surmise was soon afterward fully verified by
Mr. S. W. Burnham with the eighteen and one half inch equatorial
of the Dearborn Observatory at Chicago, revealing a close
and unequal double star which would have remained unresolved
had he used a less powerful instrument.</p>

<p>This Sherburne Wesley Burnham is the most successful discoverer
of double stars who has ever lived. &#8220;The extreme acuteness
of vision,&#8221; says Professor John Fraser, &#8220;which enables one
to prosecute such research with the highest success is a very rare
gift; and the discovery of close doubles, as in his case, is its
severest test. To measure a star&mdash;that is, to ascertain by means
of the micrometer the distance and position angle of the companion
with reference to the principal star&mdash;is one thing, and to
find new and close doubles is a very different thing. Baron
Dembowski, the most noted measurer of double stars, had no success
as a discoverer, and confessed his inability to find new
doubles. When, however, a new double had been found by another
observer, and the distance and position angle of the companion
approximately estimated, he could readily find and accurately
measure it. When Mr. Asaph Hall, in 1877, had found
the two satellites of Mars and described their positions, it was not
difficult for any astronomer who had access to a large Clark telescope
to find them and see all that Mr. Hall had seen. The whole
difficulty was in seeing them for the first time. Besides the
ability to see a difficult object, there is required an intelligence
and experimental knowledge of the subject, which are as rare as
the visual faculty itself. Some of the lower animals have more
acute vision than human beings; but they do not know all they
see, or understand relations to other facts. They have plenty of
sight, but they lack insight. Mr. Burnham&#8217;s powers in both these
respects is extraordinary.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the Cape of Good Hope Observatory remarkable observations
of double stars have been recorded. Sir David Gill, the
director, says<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;At the Cape Observatory, as has always been
the case elsewhere, the subject of double star measurement on
any great scale waited for the proper man to undertake it. There
is no instance, so far as I know, of a long and valuable series of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
double star discovery and observation made by a mere assistant
acting under orders. It is a special faculty, an inborn capacity,
a delight in the exercise of exceptional acuteness of eyesight
and natural dexterity, coupled with the gift of imagination as to
the true meaning of what he observes, that imparts to the observer
the requisite enthusiasm for double star observing. No
amount of training or direction could have created the Struves,
a Dawes or a Dembowski. The great double star observer is
born, not made, and I believe that no extensive series of double
star discovery and measurement will ever emanate from a regular
observatory through successive directorates unless men are
specially selected who have previously distinguished themselves
in that field of work, and who were originally driven to it from
sheer compulsion of inborn taste.&#8221;</p>

<h3>The Eye of a Naturalist.</h3>

<p>It is sometimes said that the faculty of observation is a special
gift with limitations, that the naturalist sees bones, feathers,
shells because he is looking for them, while
the armorer or the engineer but seldom gives
a second glance to anything but guns, girders,
or machinery.</p>

<p>To this rule we find striking exceptions. Edward S. Morse,
of Salem, Massachusetts, is the foremost American expert in
Japanese pottery. As a youth he was a railroad draughtsman in
Portland, Maine, where his ambidexterity with the pencil and his
discoveries in natural history brought him to the notice of Louis
Agassiz. As a boy he was greatly interested in the shells of his
native State; before he left school he had discovered and described
a new species of land snail, <i>Helix asteriscus</i>, which the
older naturalists had regarded as the young state of another and
well-known species. At the same time he determined the distinct
character of a most minute species, <i>Helix minutissima</i>, which
had been described as such thirty years before, but which the
later authorities had believed to be the young of another species.
This faculty for discrimination led him to demonstrate a new
bone in the ankle of birds which Huxley, and others, had supposed
to be a process and not a separate bone. This discovery
added another to the many reptilian characters which have been
disclosed in the anatomy of birds. He also established beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
question that the brachiopods, always believed to be mollusks, are
not mollusks at all, but are related to the worms. In Mr. Morse&#8217;s
case we have either a man with a universal power of observation,
or enjoying distinct faculties of perception, each usually appearing
alone in an observer. Noticing a Japanese shooting a bow and
arrow one day he took up the study of the attitude of the hand
in pulling the bow. His memoir on this subject, with illustrations,
has attracted world-wide interest. Pursuing this theme
he examined an ancient object of bronze having three prongs,
labeled as a bow-puller in European museums, showing that it
had no relation whatever with the bow. Keenly susceptible to
the beauty and variety of roofing tiles in Europe and the East,
he has for the first time given them classification, and shown
their ethnological significance. While teaching natural history
at the University of Tokio he brought together the Japanese pottery
now exhibited at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, unsurpassed
as a collection in the world. His eye was as sharp in
reading a potter&#8217;s mark, however worn and blurred, as when as
a boy in Maine he defined minute species of land shells.</p>

<h3>The Value of Collections.</h3>

<p>Altogether commendable is the spirit which leads a boy or girl
to collect and arrange shells, common wildflowers, seaweeds, and
the diverse minerals brought to light in a railroad
cutting. What is thus gathered, compared,
and studied will leave a much deeper
impression on the memory than what is seen for a moment in a
museum or a public garden. And yet, to the profound student
the museum is indispensable: he gives weeks or months to the
contents of its cases, supplementing what he has learned in the
field, by the seashore, in the woods. Take, for example, protective
resemblances, one of the most fascinating provinces of
natural history. Here is a hornet clear-wing moth. What has
made it look like a wasp? Both share the same field of life, and
while the wasp does not prey on the moth or in any perceptible
way compete with it, the two insects have a vital bond. In its
sting the wasp has so formidable and thoroughly advertised a
weapon that by closely resembling the wasp the moth, though
stingless, is able to live on its neighbor&#8217;s reputation, and escape<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
attack from the birds and insects which would devour it if they
did not fear that it is a stinging wasp. So far is the resemblance
carried that when the moth is caught in the hand it curves its
body with an attitude so wasplike as seriously to strain the nerves
of its captor.</p>

<p>How came about so elaborate a masquerade? At first, ages
ago, there was a faint likeness between the moth and the wasp;
any moth in which that likeness was unusually decided had therein
an advantage and tended to be in some measure left alone by
enemies. In thus escaping it could transmit in an ever-increasing
degree, its peculiarities of form and hue to its progeny, until in
the rapid succession of insect generations, amid the equally rapid
destruction of comparatively unprotected moths, the present
striking similarity arose. Instances of this kind abound, forming
some of the most attractive exhibits in the American Museum
of Natural History of New York, and other great museums.
Mr. W. H. Bates, who first explained these resemblances, did so
as the result of comparing many various examples preserved in
his cabinets at home, although, of course, his memory of habits
observed in the field was indispensable. His ample collections
enabled him to bring into view at once many captures separated
by wide intervals of time and space. It was the opportunity thus
afforded of taking a comprehensive survey of resemblances as a
whole that led him to think out the underlying reason.</p>

<h3>Accidental Observation.</h3>

<p>Accident has played a noteworthy part in both discovery and
invention. Nathaniel Hayward long ago remarked that sulphur
deprives rubber of stickiness. Charles Goodyear
one day combined some rubber and sulphur
by way of experiment; quite by accident
he overturned part of the mixture upon a hot stove. He saw in
a moment that heat is essential to make rubber insensible to both
heat and cold: he had indeed discovered vulcanization. Examples
of this kind abound in the history of every art. As far
afield as the war on insect pests in France a priceless discovery
was hit upon unsought a few years ago. One autumn the vines
were still suffering from phylloxera when a mildew caused by a
fungus began to do serious damage to crops. Through the spraying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
of vines with blue-stone to prevent pilfering of fruit, it was
noticed that the fungus was killed, leading to the most telling
mode of attack on many of the pests which assail leaves, flowers
and fruit.</p>

<p>James Hargreaves once saw a spinning-wheel overturned, when
both the wheel and spindle continued to revolve on the floor. As
he observed the spindle thus changed from a horizontal to an
upright position it occurred to him that if a number of spindles
were thus placed, side by side, several threads might be spun at
once instead of a single thread. This was the origin of the spinning
jenny; an invention which has parallels in the multiple
drills, the gang-saws, and other machinery which take a task
once executed by a single drill, saw or punch, and simultaneously
perform it with ten, twenty, or a hundred drills, saws, or punches.</p>

<p>About thirty years before Josiah Wedgwood laid the foundation
of his future eminence, a chance observation gave rise to
improvement in the earthenwares of Staffordshire. A potter
from Burslem, the centre of the potteries and the birthplace of
Wedgwood, in traveling to London on horseback was detained
on the road by the inflamed eyes of his horse. Seeing the hostler,
the horse-doctor of those times, burn a piece of flint, and, having
reduced it to a fine powder, apply it as a specific to the diseased
eyes, it occurred to the potter that this beautiful white powder,
if combined with the clay used in his craft, might improve the
strength and color of his ware. An experiment succeeded, and
so began English white ware, since manufactured on an immense
scale.</p>

<p>More important than this discovery of a new use for flint
powder was the discovery, also accidental, of electro-magnetism
by Professor Oersted of Copenhagen. The incident is thus related
in a letter to Michael Faraday from Professor Christian
Hansteen<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Professor Oersted was a man of genius, but he was a very unhappy
experimenter; he could not manipulate instruments. He
must always have an assistant, or one of his auditors who had
easy hands, to arrange the experiment; I have often in this way
assisted him. In the eighteenth century there was a general
thought that there was a great conformity, and perhaps identity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
between the electrical and magnetical forces; and it was a question
how to demonstrate it by experiments. Oersted tried to place
the wire of his galvanic battery perpendicular (at right angles)
over the magnetic needle, but remarked no sensible motion. Once,
after the end of his lecture, as he had used a strong galvanic
battery to other experiments, he said, &#8216;Let us now once, as the
battery is in activity, try to place the wire parallel with the
needle;&#8217; as this was done he was quite struck with perplexity by
seeing the needle making a great oscillation (almost at right
angles with the magnetic meridian). Then he said, &#8216;Let us now
invert the direction of the current;&#8217; and the needle deviated in
the contrary direction. Thus the great detection was made; and
it has been said, not without reason, that &#8216;he tumbled over it by
accident.&#8217; He had not before any more idea than any other person
that the force should be transversal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Granting that many important discoveries thus come about in
ways beyond human foresight, accident alone will not produce
an invention. As Dr. Ernst Mach reminds us, in every such case
the inquirer is obliged to take note of the new fact, to recognize
its significance, to detect the part it plays, or can be made to play,
in a new structure, or in a novel and sound generalization. What
he sees before him, others also have seen, perhaps many times;
he is the first to notice it as it deserves to be noticed, simply because
he has an eye earnestly desiring to behold just such a fact
as this and use it to bridge a gap either in art or explanation.</p>

<p>Let us take a case where an accident, well observed, has meant
a golden discovery. One day during a trip on the Thames in a
steamer propelled by an Archimedean screw devised by Francis
Pettit Smith, the propeller struck an obstacle in the water, so
that about one half of the length of the screw was broken off; it
was noticed that the vessel immediately shot ahead at a much
quickened pace. In consequence of this discovery, a new short
screw was fitted to the vessel and with this new propeller the
steamer went uniformly faster than before.</p>

<h3>Perforated Sails for Ships.</h3>

<p>In craft built ages before steamers were designed, fishermen
have observed that sails torn in the middle, if the rents were not
too big, were more effective than when new and whole. What
thus began in sheer wear, or accidental damage, is now imitated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
of set purpose. Under the equator one may often see small craft
whose sails are matting woven with large openings, as the sailors
say &#8220;to let out the wind.&#8221; The mariners of
Carthegena, St. Thomas, and other islands of
the West Indies, know that a ship goes
better thus than if her sails were each one continuous breadth
of canvas. Japanese junks of clipper builds have sails made of
vertical breadths laced together so as to leave large apertures
free to the air. Why is this breeziness of structure profitable?
Because against the concave surface of an ordinary sail the wind
rebounds so as to hinder its impulsive effect; through an aperture
the air rushes in a continuous current and no rebound takes
place. For a like reason, and with similar gain, Chinese rudders
are made with separated boards or planks. The stream of water
passing through such a rudder would exert an undesirable back
pressure in a rudder of solid form.</p>

1, jib. 2, stay-sail. 3, square sail. 4, top sail.
5, sloop with perforated sails.</p>
</div>

<p>It would be interesting, and might prove gainful, to experiment
with perforated sails in sail-boats, ice-boats and wind-mills. In
large kites, sent to the upper air by meteorologists, it has been
found helpful to give the fabric a few small perforations.</p>

<h3>Observations Must be Remembered and Compared: The Value of a New Eye.</h3>

<p>It is not only necessary to observe if one would learn, one must
remember and compare observations. In a cycle of 223 lunations
all the motions of the moon are repeated; it is
astonishing that astronomers in Chaldea detected
this period, exceeding eighteen years as
it does. On the other hand, one of the most
striking phenomena of a solar eclipse, its
revelation of the solar corona, does not seem
to have been noticed until comparatively recent times. The first
known record of it is by Lobatchevsky, July 8, 1842.</p>

<p>There is value in the teaching which teaches the eye what to
observe; at times there is gain in a freshness of view unwarped
by ideas as to what deserves to be inspected and what does not.
Dr. Priestley, one of the founders of chemistry, says<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;I do not
at all think it degrading to the business of experimental philosophy
to compare it, as I often do, to the diversion of hunting,
where it sometimes happens that those who beat the ground the
most, and are consequently best acquainted with it, weary themselves
without starting any game, when it may fall in the way
of a mere passenger; so that there is but little room for boasting
in the most successful termination of the chase.&#8221; True, yet this
discerning eye will always be found beside a brain of uncommon
force and sweep. Mr. Edwin Reynolds, of Milwaukee, as <a href="#Page_345">related</a>
in this book, never saw a mining stamp until the morning
when he planned a bold and profitable simplification of it. Professor
Alexander Graham Bell, who invented the telephone, came
to his triumph not as a disciplined electrician, but as a student,
under his father, of articulate speech and its transmission. He
has told me that had he known the obstacles to be surmounted,
he would never have begun his attack.</p>

<p>Professor Ernst Abbe, of Jena, who more than any other investigator
is to be credited with the production of Jena glass,
was at the outset of his labors quite ignorant of practical optics.
But he had a thorough mastery of mathematical optics, and this
in due season enabled him to revise the theory of the microscope,
and to prescribe the conditions according to which the manufacture
of totally new kinds of glass should proceed. Every one
of these men, every peer they have ever had among the volunteer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
forces of research, is far removed in native ability, in plasticity
of mind, from Priestley&#8217;s &#8220;mere passenger.&#8221; If ignorance by
itself were the chief qualification for discovery, science would
long ago have entered upon its golden age.</p>

<h3>Any Observation May Have Value.</h3>

<p>Michael Faraday, that consummate observer, held that at times
the observations of comparatively untrained men are well worth
attention. In one of his note-books he wrote<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;Whilst
passing through manufactories and
engaged in the observance of the various
operations of civilized life, we are constantly
hearing observations made by those who find employment in these
places, and are accustomed to a minute observation of what passes
before them which are new or frequently discordant with received
opinions. These are frequently the result of facts, and
though some are founded in error, some on prejudice, yet many
are true and of high importance to the practical man. Such of
them as come in my way I shall set down here, without waiting
for the principle on which they depend; and though three fourths
of them ultimately prove to be erroneous, yet if but one new fact
is gathered in a multitude, it will be sufficient to justify this mode
of occupying time.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Folk Observation Foreruns Science.</h3>

<p>Often a conviction widely held by the plain people of a countryside
is based on many and sound observations, long before a
scientific theory accounts for the facts. For
many generations there was a saying among
German peasants that when a storm is approaching
a fire should be made in the stove,
with as much smoke as possible. Professor Schuster has shown
that this saying and the custom founded upon it are rational, as
the products of combustion and the smoke act as an effective conductor
to discharge the atmosphere slowly but surely. He quotes
statistics showing that out of each 1000 cases of lightning stroke,
6.3 churches and 8.5 mills were struck, and but 0.3 factory chimneys.
Only the factories had fires burning.</p>

<p>A mighty work has been wrought by glaciers on the surface of
our globe. Long before this fact was discovered by professional
geologists it was clear to many of the plainer people. Jean de
Charpentier, one of the first propounders of the theory of glacial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
action now fundamental in geological science, relates<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;When
in the year 1815, I returned from the magnificent glaciers of the
valley of the Rhone, I spent the night in the hamlet of Lourtier,
in the cottage of Perraudin, a chamois-hunter. Our conversation
turned on the peculiarities of the country, and especially of the
glaciers which he had repeatedly explored and knew most intimately.
&#8216;Our glaciers,&#8217; said Perraudin, &#8216;had formerly a much
larger extent than now. Our whole valley was occupied by a
glacier extending as far as Martigny, as is proved by the boulders
in the vicinity of this town, and which are far too large for the
water to have carried them thither.&#8217;&#8221; Charpentier adds that he
afterward met with similar explanations on the part of mountaineers
in other sections of Switzerland.</p>

<p>Cowpox was long observed by English country folk to be a
preventive of smallpox. It was in hearing a servant woman say
so that Dr. Jenner was drawn to the study which ended in his
successful vaccinations, in all the triumphs since won in this department
of medical science. For two thousand years the peasants
of Italy have suspected mosquitoes and other insects to be concerned
in the spread of malarial and other fevers. It remained
for Dr. Ronald Ross in our day to prove that the suspicion was
founded in truth. In &#8220;The Naturalist in La Plata,&#8221; one of the
best books on natural history ever written, Mr. W. H. Hudson
says<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;The country people in South America believe that the
milky secretion exuded by the toad possesses wonderful curative
properties; it is their invariable specific for shingles&mdash;a painful,
dangerous malady common amongst them, and to cure it living
toads are applied to the inflamed part. I dare say learned physicians
would laugh at this cure, but then, if I mistake not, the
learned have in past times laughed at other specifics used by the
vulgar, but which now have honorable places in the pharmacop&#339;ia&mdash;pepsine,
for example. More than two centuries ago, very
ancient times for South America, the gauchos were accustomed
to take the lining of the rhea&#8217;s (a large ostrich&#8217;s) stomach, dried
and powdered, for ailments caused by impaired digestion; and the
remedy is popular still. Science has gone over to them, and the
ostrich-hunter now makes a double profit, one from the feathers,
and the other from the dried stomachs which he supplies to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
chemists of Buenos Ayres. Yet he was formerly told that to take
the stomach of the ostrich to improve his digestion was as wild
an idea as it would be to swallow birds&#8217; feathers in order to fly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Snake poison has long been used by the Hottentots as an antidote
to snake poison. With aid from the Carnegie Institution of
Washington, Dr. Hideyo Noguchi, of the University of Pennsylvania,
has succeeded in producing antivenins, to use the medical
term, for the venoms of the water-moccasin and <i>Crotalus adamanteus</i>
snakes, using the venoms themselves in preparing his antidotes.
He is continuing his researches in this remarkable field
of the healing art.</p>

<p>Kelp, as it drifts and sways in the Atlantic, attracts from the sea
both the iodine and the bromine dissolved in minute quantities in
the sea-water. This trait of fastening upon a particular and rare
element is displayed by plants on land as well as by sea-weeds.
In the Horn silver mine of Utah, the zinc mingled with the silver
is betokened by the abundance of a zinc violet, <i>Viola calaminaria</i>,
a delicate cousin of the pansy. In Germany this little flower was
believed to point to zinc deposits long before zinc was discovered
in its juices. The late Mr. William Dorn, of South Carolina, had
faith in a bush of unrecorded name, as declaring that gold veins
stood beneath it: that his faith was not baseless is proved by the
large fortune he won as a gold miner in the Blue Ridge country&mdash;his
guide the bush aforesaid. Mr. Rossiter W. Raymond, a
famous mining engineer of New York, has given some attention
to &#8220;indicative plants&#8221; of this kind. He is of opinion that their
unwritten lore among practical miners, prospectors, hunters, and
Indians is well worth sifting.</p>

<p>He says<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;Judging from the general laws of the distribution
of plants, and from the analogy furnished by <i>Viola calaminaria</i>,
we may expect that an indicative plant will be, not a distinct
species, but a variety of some widely distributed species, the range
of the species as a whole being determined by general conditions
of climate, altitude and soil, while the characteristics of the variety
are affected by causes peculiar to the mineral deposit. Temperature
and moisture, as Agricola long ago pointed out, are among
these causes, and color is one of the most sensitive of their effects.
It is quite reasonable to believe the soil may affect the color of the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
plant absorbing it. On the other hand, it is not certain, even if a
plant is proved to indicate by color or other peculiarities the
presence of silver, that silver is the substance actually entering
into and altering the plant. The effect may be due to some other
mineral substances associated with the silver-ores; and our silver-plant
may be indicative of silver in a silver region only.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Raymond remarks that a general relation between the flora
and the geological formation of any given district is a fact
familiar to field-geologists. Many plants, too, indicate the neighborhood
of water. A botanist knowing the root-length, water-requirements
and habits of different species can often determine
from the surface vegetation, he tells us, the nature, amount and
distance of the underground water-supply.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<h3>A Lesson from a Bank-Swallow.</h3>

<p>Between the Winooski Valley and Lake
Champlain, north of the city of Burlington, lies
a broad sand plain high above the lake level, through which the
Central Vermont Railroad was to be carried in a tunnel. But the
sand was destitute of moisture or cohesiveness, and the engineers,
after expending a large sum of money, decided that the tunnel
could not be constructed because there were no means of sustaining
the material during the building of the masonry. The removal
of so large a quantity of material from a cut of such dimensions
also involved an expense that was prohibitory. The route was
consequently given up and the road built in a crooked ravine
through the centre of the city, involving ascending and descending
grades of more than 130 feet to the mile. When the railroad was
opened these grades were found to involve a cost which practically
drove the through freights to a competing railroad.</p>

<p>There was at the time a young man in the engineers&#8217; office of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
railroad who said that he could tunnel the sand bank at a very
small cost. He was summoned before the managers and questioned.
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I can build the tunnel for so many dollars
per running foot, but I cannot expect you to act upon my
opinion when so many American and European engineers have
declared the project impracticable.&#8221; The managers knew that the
first fifty feet of the tunnel involved all the difficulties. They offered
him, and he accepted, a contract to build fifty feet of the
structure.</p>

<p>His plan was simplicity itself. On a vertical face of the bank
he marked the line of an arch larger than the tunnel. On this
line he drove into the bank sharpened timbers, twelve feet long,
three by four inches square. Then he removed six feet of the
material and drove in another arch, just inside the first one, of
twelve-foot timbers, took out six feet more of sand, and repeated
this process until he had space enough to commence the masonry.
As fast as this was completed the space above it was filled, leaving
the timbers in place.</p>

<p>Thus he progressed, keeping the masonry well up to the excavation,
until he had pierced the bank with the cheapest tunnel ever
constructed, which has carried the traffic of a great railroad for
thirty years, and now stands as firm as on its completion.</p>

<p>The engineer was asked if there was any suggestion of the
structure adopted by him in the books on engineering. &#8220;No,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;it came to me in this way. I was driving by the place where
the first attempts were made, of which a colony of bank-swallows
had taken possession. It occurred to me that these little engineers
had disproved the assertion that this material had no cohesion.
They have their homes in it, where they raise two families every
summer. Every home is a tunnel, self-sustaining without
masonry. A larger tunnel can be constructed by simply extending
the principle, and adopting masonry. This is the whole story.
The bank-swallow is the inventor of this form of tunnel construction.
I am simply a copyist&mdash;his imitator.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Early Talent in Construction.</h3>

<p class="chapstart">An inventor is a man of unusual powers. To begin with he is
cast in a larger mold than ordinary men; he has keener eyes,
more skilful hands, a better knitting quality of brain. In his
heart he believes every engine, machine, and process to be improvable
without limit. He is thoroughly dissatisfied
with things as they are and alert to
detect where an old method can be bettered, or
a gift wholly new be conferred on mankind, as
in the telephone or the phonograph. His uncommon faculty of
observation we have had occasion to remark. Another talent as
much in evidence, and quite irrepressible even in early life, impels
him to make, weave, and build. Invariably the man who has added
to the resources of architecture, engineering, machine design, has
begun as a boy in repeating the rabbit-hutches, windmills, and
whittled sailing craft of bigger boys. This means that he soon
acquires a mastery of chisel, plane, and drill, that the lathe becomes
as obedient to him as his own hand. Watt, Maudslay,
Stephenson, and every peer they ever had, could go to the bench
and make a valve, a mitre-wheel, a link-motion just as imaged in
their mind&#8217;s eye. Lacking this dexterity other men, occasionally
fertile in good ideas, never bring them to the birth.</p>

<p>While inventors owe their talents to nature, these talents need
sound training, if at a master&#8217;s hands, so much the better. Just
as the best place to learn how to paint, is the studio of a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
artist, so the best school for ingenuity is the workshop of a great
inventor. Maudslay, who devised the slide-rest for lathes, and
Clement, who designed the first rotary planer, were trained by
Bramah, who invented the famous hydraulic press, and locks of
radically new and excellent pattern. Whitworth, who created
lathes of new refinement, who established new and exact standards
of measurement in manufacturing, was trained by Maudslay;
so was Nasmyth, who devised the steam hammer. Mr. Edison
in his laboratory and workshop has called forth the ingenuity of
many an assistant who has since won fame and fortune by independent
work.</p>

<p>But as a rule inventors, like the vast brotherhood of other men,
must toil by themselves, and get what good they can out of unaided
diligence. Cobbett used to say that he thought with the
point of his pen; the very act of writing lifted into consciousness
many an idea which otherwise had died stillborn. Beethoven,
like all other great tone-poets, would play a few bars as they came
to his imagination, and while he touched the keys the music, as if
with pinions of its own, took such heavenly flights as those of
the Fifth Symphony. In just this mode while an inventor is shaping
a new model he feels how he can better its lines, give it a
simpler design than he first intended. His hands and eyes think
as well as his brain; while lever, link, and cam unite together they
suggest how they may be more compactly built, more effectively
joined. His partner, the discoverer, is under the same spell with
regard to some long-standing puzzle of rock, or plant, or star. Because
in his soul he believes nature to be intelligible to her very
core, he is sure that this particular puzzle can be fathomed, and
he keeps thinking day by day of possible solutions. At other
times, and even during sleep, his brain is subconsciously at work
upon his problem, bringing to view promising points for attack.
With new light he is bold enough to say, this problem can be
solved by me. At last dawns the happy morning when he verifies
a shrewd guess, or when a crucial experiment stamps a theory as
proven truth, indispensable aid having arisen as one attempt,
through baffling failure, suggested the next. All boys and girls
are the better, happier, more useful when they are early and
thoroughly trained to use their eyes, ears, and hands; to the inventor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
and discoverer this training opens a career which otherwise
is denied.</p>

<p>Among the greatest of the sons of men who have united the
faculties of invention and discovery stands Sir Isaac Newton. As
with his compeers we find that his art as an inventor was but the
flower of his handicraft as a mechanic.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac Newton almost from the cradle was a builder. His
biographer, Sir David Brewster, says<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<h3>Newton as a Boy&mdash;A Tireless Constructor.</h3>

<p>&#8220;He had not been long at school before he
exhibited a taste for mechanical inventions.
With the aid of little saws, hammers, hatchets,
and tools of all sorts, he was constantly occupied
during his play hours in the construction of models of known
machines, and amusing contrivances. The most important pieces
of mechanism which he thus constructed, were a windmill, a
water-clock, and a carriage to be moved by the person who sat in
it. When a windmill was in course of being erected near Grantham,
Sir Isaac frequently watched the operations of the workmen,
and acquired such a thorough knowledge of its mechanism, that
he completed a working model of it, which Dr. Stukely says was
as clean and curious a piece of workmanship as the original. This
model was frequently placed on the top of the house in which he
lived at Grantham, and was put in motion by the action of the
wind upon its sails. In calm weather, however, another mechanical
agent was required, and for this purpose a mouse was put
in requisition, which went by the name of miller.</p>

<p>&#8220;The water-clock constructed by Sir Isaac was a more useful
piece of mechanism than his windmill. It was made out of a box
which he begged from Mrs. Clark&#8217;s brother, and, according to
Dr. Stukely, to whom it was described by those who had seen it,
it resembled pretty much our common clocks and clock-cases, but
was less in size, being about four feet in height, and of a proportional
breadth. There was a dial-plate at top with figures of
the hours. The index was turned by a piece of wood, which either
fell or rose by water dropping.</p>

<p>&#8220;The mechanical carriage which Sir Isaac is said to have invented,
was a four-wheeled vehicle, and was moved with a handle
or winch wrought by the person who sat in it. We can find no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
distinct information respecting its construction or use, but it
must have resembled a Merlin&#8217;s chair, which is fitted to move
only on the smooth surface of a floor, and not overcome the inequalities
of a common road.</p>

<p>&#8220;He introduced the flying of paper kites, and is said to have investigated
their best forms and proportions, as well as the number
and position of the points to which the string should be attached.
He constructed also lanterns of crimpled paper, in which he placed
a candle to light him to school in the dark winter mornings; and
in the dark nights he tied them to the tails of his kites, in order to
terrify the country people, who took them for comets.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the yard of the house where he lived, he was frequently
observed to watch the motion of the sun. He drove wooden pegs
into the walls and roofs of the buildings, as gnomons to mark
by their shadows the hours and half-hours of the day. It does
not appear that he knew how to adjust these lines to the latitude
of Grantham; but he is said to have succeeded, after some years&#8217;
observation, in making them so exact that anybody could tell what
o&#8217;clock it was by Isaac&#8217;s dial, as it was called.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Isaac himself told Mr. Conduit that one of the earliest
scientific experiments which he made was in 1658, on the day of
the great storm when Cromwell died, and when he himself had
just entered into his sixteenth year. In order to determine the
force of the gale he jumped first in the direction in which the
wind blew, and then in opposition to the wind; and after measuring
the length of the leap in both directions, and comparing it
with the length to which he could jump on a perfectly calm day,
he was enabled to compute the force of the storm. Sir Isaac
added, that when his companions seemed surprised at his saying
that any particular wind was a foot stronger than any he had
known before, he carried them to the place where he had made the
experiment, and showed them the measure and marks of his
several leaps.</p>

<p>&#8220;When a young man he made a telescope with his own hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>James Watt, who became the chief improver of the steam engine,
when a boy received from his father a set of small carpentry
tools. The little fellow would take his toys to pieces, rebuild them
and invent playthings wholly new. A cousin of his, Mrs. Campbell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
has recorded that Watt as a lad was often blamed for idleness;
she adds<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<h3>Watt as an Inquiring Boy.</h3>

<p>&#8220;His active mind was employed in investigating the properties
of steam; he was then fifteen, and once in conversation
he informed me that he had read
twice, with great attention, S&#8217;Gravesande&#8217;s
&#8216;Elements of Natural Philosophy,&#8217; adding that
it was the first book upon that subject put into his hands, and that
he still thought it one of the best. While under his father&#8217;s roof,
he went on with various chemical experiments, repeating them
again and again until satisfied of their accuracy from his own observations.
He had made for himself a small electrical machine,
and sometimes startled his young friends by giving them sudden
shocks from it.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Astonishing Precocity of Ericsson.</h3>

<p>John Ericsson as a child was the wonder of the neighborhood,
says his biographer, Mr. William C. Conant. From the first he
exhibited the qualities distinguishing him in
later life. His industry was ceaseless; he was
busy from morning to night drawing, planning
and constructing. The machinery at the mines
near his home was to him an endless source of wonder and delight.
In the early morning he hastened to the works, carrying with
him a drawing pencil, bits of paper, pieces of wood, and a few
rude tools. There he would remain the day through, seeking to
discover the principles of motion in the machines, and striving to
copy their forms. In his tenth year this boy undertook to design
a pump for draining the mines of water. The motor was to be a
windmill. Such a contrivance the young inventor had never
seen, yet he succeeded in drawing designs for his mill after the
most approved fashion of skilled engineers by following a verbal
description given by his father of a mill he had just visited.</p>

<h3>Rowland&#8217;s Early Experiments.</h3>

<p>Henry A. Rowland became at Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore one of the great physical investigators and inventors
of the nineteenth century. As a boy he delighted
in chemical experiments, glass-blowing,
and similar occupations. The family were
often summoned by the young enthusiast to
listen to lectures which were fully illustrated by experiments, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
always free from prospective danger. His first five-dollar bill
bought him, to his delight, a galvanic battery. The sheets of the
New York &#8220;Observer&#8221; he converted into a hot-air balloon, which
made a brilliant ascent and flight, setting fire, at last, to the roof
of a neighboring house. One day he saw a pump at work in the
hold of a steamer, sending out a stream which fell from a height
of five or six feet to the river. &#8220;Why,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;don&#8217;t you
put that pipe down into the river and save power?&#8221; As a student
at the Troy Polytechnical Institute he invented a method of
winding naked strips of wire on cloth so as virtually to effect its
insulation. This was afterward profitably patented by some one
else.</p>

considers the inventing and discovering mind<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<h3>The Passion for Experiment.</h3>

<p>&#8220;Not one of the leading mental peculiarities
applicable to scientific constructiveness can be
dispensed with in the constructions of practice<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>the
intellectual store of ideas applicable
to the special department; the powerful action of the associating
forces; a very clear perception of the end, in other words, sound
judgment; and, lastly, that patient thought, which is properly
an entranced devotion of the energies to the subject in hand,
rendering application to it spontaneous and easy.</p>

<p>&#8220;With reference to originality in all departments, whether
science, practice, or fine art, there is a point of character that deserves
notice, as being more obviously of value in practical inventions
and in the conduct of business and affairs&mdash;I mean an
active turn, or a profuseness of energy, put forth in trials of all
kinds on the chance of making lucky hits. In science, meditation
and speculation can do much, but in practice, a disposition to try
experiments is of the utmost service. Nothing less than a fanaticism
of experimentation could have given birth to some of our
grandest practical combinations. The great discovery of Daguerre,
for example, could not have been regularly worked out
by any systematic and orderly research; there was no way but to
stumble upon it, so unlikely and remote were the actions brought
together in one consecutive process. The discovery is unaccountable,
until we learn that the author had been devoting himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
to experiments for improving the diorama, and thereby got
deeply involved in trials and operations far removed from the
beaten paths of inquiry. The energy that prompts to endless
attempts was found in a surprising degree in Kepler. A similar
untiring energy&mdash;the union of an active temperament with intense
fascination for his subject&mdash;appears in the character of Sir William
Herschel. When these two attributes are conjoined; when
profuse active vigor operates on a field that has an unceasing
charm for the mind, we then see human nature surpassing itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;The invention of photography by Daguerre illustrates the
probable method whereby some of the most ancient inventions
were arrived at. The inventions of the scarlet dye, of glass, of
soap, of gunpowder, could have come only by accident; but the
accident, in most of them, would probably fall into the hands of
men engaged in numerous trials upon the materials involved. Intense
application&mdash;&#8216;days of watching, nights of waking&#8217;&mdash;went
with ancient discoveries, as well as with modern. In the historical
instances, we know as much. The mental absorption of Archimedes
is a proverb.</p>

<p>&#8220;The wonderful part of Daguerre&#8217;s discovery consists in the
succession of processes that had to concur in one operation before
any effect could arise. Having taken a silver plate, iodine
is first used to coat the surface; the surface is then exposed to
the light, but the effect produced is not apparent till the plate
has been immersed in the vapor of mercury. To fall upon such
a combination, without any clue derived from previous knowledge,
an innumerable series of fruitless trials must have been
gone through.</p>

<p>&#8220;A remark may be made here, applicable alike to science and
to practice. Originality in either takes two form&mdash;observation
or experiment on the one hand, and the identifying processes of
abstraction, induction, and deduction on the other. In the first,
the bodily activities and the senses are requisite; the last are the
purely intellectual forces. It is not by high intellectual force that
a man discovers new countries, new plants, new properties of objects;
it is by putting forth an unusual force of activity, adventure,
inquisitorial and persevering search. All this is necessary
in order to obtain the observations and facts in the first instance;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
when these are collected in sufficient number, a different aptitude
is brought to bear. By identifying and assimilating the scattered
materials, general properties and general truths are obtained, and
these may be pushed deductively into new applications; in all
which a powerful reach of similarity is the first requisite; and
this may be owned by men totally destitute of the active qualities
necessary for observation and experiment.&#8221;</p>

<h3>The Chief Impulse in Discovery.</h3>

<p>In &#8220;The Hazard of New Fortunes&#8221; Mr. W. D. Howells depicts
a man of force who, without education, becomes rich. He has
little patience with poor men, who, he says,
&#8220;don&#8217;t get what they want because they don&#8217;t
want it bad enough.&#8221; The rough old
Westerner, Dryfoos, was sound in his view.
Success in discovery as in money-making is as much a matter of
passion as of intelligence, says Mr. O. F. Cook<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The first and most essential preliminary for a successful investigation
is an interest in the question, and any method which
tends to diminish or relax interest is false and futile. Diligence
in learning the facts of a science is a distinctly unfavorable symptom
in a would-be investigator when unaccompanied by a vital
constructive interest. That a student hoards facts does not mean
that he will build anything with them. Intellectual misers are
common, and are quite as unprofitable as the monetary variety.
A scientific specialist may have vast knowledge and life-long experience,
and yet may never entertain an original idea or make
a new rift in the wall of the unknown which baffled his predecessors.
Indeed, such men commonly resent a readjustment of the
bounds of knowledge as an interference with their vested capital
of erudition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Investigation is a sentiment, an instinct, a habit of mind; it
is man&#8217;s effort at knowing and enjoying the universe. The productive
investigator desires knowledge for a purpose; he may not
be eager for knowledge in general, nor for new knowledge in
particular. He values details for their bearing on the problem
he hopes to solve. He can gather and sift them to advantage only
in the light of a radiant interest, and his ability to utilize them
for correct information depends on the delicacy of his perception
and the strength of his mental grasp. The investigator, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
athlete, must first be born; he can not be made to order, but his
training determines the degree of excellence to which he can
attain. No amount of training can remove organic defects, but
bad training may be worse than none in lessening the attainment
of the most capable. That education is false and injurious which
puts the matter first and retards or prevents the development of
constructive mental ability, a power not peculiar to the investigator,
but in him reaching the greatest scope and freedom of
action.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Aid from Picturing Power.</h3>

<p>A picturing faculty such as comes to the flower in an inventor
may often be observed in a skilful workman. In a shoe factory
a veteran will lift a hide, utterly irregular in
form, and cut soles and heels from it, so that
the remaining scraps are a mere trifle, while
flaws have been avoided.</p>

<p>Hugh Miller, in &#8220;My Schools and Schoolmasters,&#8221; thus speaks
of a fellow stone-mason<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;John Fraser&#8217;s strength had never
been above the average of that of Scotchmen, and it was now
considerably reduced; nor did his mallet deal more or heavier
blows than that of the common workman. He had, however, an
extraordinary power of conceiving of the finished piece of work,
as lying within the rude stone from which it was his business to
disinter it; and while ordinary stone-cutters had to repeat and re-repeat
their lines and draughts, and had in this way virtually to
give their work several surfaces in detail ere they reached the
true one, old John cut upon the true figure at once, and made one
surface serve for all. In building, too, he exercised a similar
power; he hammer-dressed his stones with fewer strokes than
other workmen, and in fitting the interspaces between the stones
already laid, always picked from out the heap at his feet the stone
that exactly filled the place; while other operatives busied themselves
in picking up stones that were too small or too large; or,
if they set themselves to reduce the too large ones, reduced them
too little or too much, and had to fit and fit again. Whether building
or hewing, John never seemed in a hurry. He has been seen,
when far advanced in life, working very leisurely, as became his
years, on one side of a wall, and two stout young fellows building
against him on the other side&mdash;toiling, apparently, twice harder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
than he, but the old man always contriving to keep a little ahead
of them both.&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry Maudslay, famous as an inventor, had the same exquisite
sense of form. When he executed a piece of work he
was greatly indebted to the dexterity he had acquired as a blacksmith
in early life. He used to say that to be a good smith you
must be able to see in an iron bar the object you mean to get out
of it with hammer and chisel, just as the sculptor sees the statue
he intends to carve from a block of marble.</p>

<h3>Eyes and Hands Inform the Brain.</h3>

<p>Inventors and artists have in common a keen perception of
form, an ability to confer form with skill and accuracy. Often
the same man is at once inventor and artist.
Of this class Leonardo da Vinci is the most
illustrious example. Alexander Nasmyth, of
Edinburgh, who invented the bow-string
bridge, was an eminent painter of portraits and landscapes. His
son, James Nasmyth, who devised the steam hammer and the
steam pile-driver, tells us in his autobiography<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;My father taught me to sketch with exactness every object,
whether natural or artificial, so as to enable the hand accurately
to reproduce what the eye had seen. In order to acquire this almost
invaluable art, he was careful to educate my eye, so that I
might perceive the relative proportions of objects placed before
me. He would throw down at random a number of bricks, or
pieces of wood representing them, and set me to copy their forms,
proportions, lights and shadows. I have often heard him say that
any one who could make a correct drawing in regard to outline,
and also indicate by a few effective touches the variation of lights
and shadows of such a group of model objects, might not despair
of making a good and correct sketch of York Minster. My
father was an enthusiast in praise of this <i>graphic language</i>, and
I have followed his example. In fact it formed a principal part
of my own education. It gave me the power of recording observations
with a few graphic strokes of the pencil, and far surpassing
in expression any number of mere words. This graphic
eloquence is one of the highest gifts in conveying clear and correct
ideas as to the forms of objects&mdash;whether they be those of
a simple and familiar kind, or of some form of mechanical construction,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
or of the details of a fine building, or the characteristic
features of a wide-stretching landscape. This accomplishment
of accurate drawing, which I achieved for the most part in my
father&#8217;s workroom, served me many a good turn in future years
with reference to the engineering work which became the business
of my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>His mastery of the pencil had undoubtedly a great deal to do in
cultivating his powers of inventive imagination. He says<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;It
is one of the most delightful results of the possession of the constructive
faculty, that one can build up in the mind mechanical
structures and set them to work in imagination, and observe beforehand
the various details performing their respective functions,
as if they were in absolute form and action. Unless this
happy faculty exists in the brain of the mechanical engineer, he
will have a hard and disappointing life before him. It is the
early cultivation of the imagination which gives the right flexibility
to the thinking faculty.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Manual Training.</h3>

<p>Drawing is one of the courses in every manual training school
in America. The first of these schools was organized in 1879
St. Louis, under the direction of Professor C.
M. Woodward. Within the past thirty years,
from the kindergarten to the university, American
education has addressed itself as never before to bringing
out all the talents of pupils and students. In earlier days there
was little appeal to sense perception, to dexterity, to the faculties
of eye and hand which all too soon pass out of plasticity, to leave
the young man or woman for life destitute of powers which,
had they been duly elicited, would have broadened their careers
by widening their horizons. To-day, happily, our schools are more
and more supplementing literary and mathematical courses with
instruction in the use of tools, in modeling, design, and pattern-making.
Every process is thoroughly explained. All the studies
are linked into series; these unite practice and its reasons with a
thoroughness impossible in the outworn schemes of apprenticeship.</p>

<p>All this is a distinct aid to inventiveness. As Professor Woodward
says in &#8220;Manual Training in Education&#8221;<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;Manual training
cultivates a capacity for executive work, a certain power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
creation. Every manual exercise involves the execution of a
clearly defined plan. Familiar steps and processes are to be combined
with new ones in a rational order and for a definite purpose.
As a rule these exercises are carefully chosen by the instructor.
At proper times and in reasonable degree, pupils are set to forming
and executing their own plans. Here is developed not a single
faculty, but a combination of many faculties. Memory, comparison,
imagination, and a train of reasoning, all are necessary
in creating something new out of the old.&#8221;</p>

<h3>How the Phonograph was Born.</h3>

<p>Every inventor of mark is a man of native dexterity whose
skill has been thoroughly cultivated. Let us observe such a man
as he came to an extraordinary triumph. One
of the great inventions of all time is the
phonograph, giving us as it does accurate records
of sound which may be repeated as often
as we please. The ideas which issued in the perfected instrument
were for years germinating in Mr. Edison&#8217;s mind; they took their
rise in his recording telegraph. One afternoon Mr. Edison told
the story to the late Mr. George Parsons Lathrop, who published
it in Harpers&#8217; Magazine for February, 1890<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;I worked a circuit
in the daytime at Indianapolis, and got a small salary for doing
it. But at night with another operator named Parmley, I used
to receive newspaper reports just for the practice. The regular
operator, who was given to copious libations, was glad enough to
sleep off the effects while we did his work for him as well as we
could. I would sit down for ten minutes, and take as much as I
could from the instrument, carrying the rest in my memory.
Then, while I wrote out, Parmley would serve his turn at taking;
and so on. This worked well until they put a new man on at the
Cincinnati end. He was one of the quickest despatchers in the
business, and we soon found it was hopeless for us to try to keep
up with him. Then it was that I worked out my first invention,
and necessity was certainly the mother of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got two old Morse registers, and arranged them in such a
way that by running a strip of paper through them, the dots and
dashes were recorded on it by the first instrument as fast as they
were delivered from the Cincinnati end, and were transmitted to
us through the other instrument at any desired rate of speed or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
slowness. They would come in on one instrument at the rate of
forty words a minute, and we would grind them out of the other
at the rate of twenty-five. Then weren&#8217;t we proud! Our copy
used to be so clean and beautiful that we hung it up on exhibition;
and our manager used to come and gaze at it silently, with a
puzzled expression. Then he would depart, shaking his head in a
troubled sort of way. He could not understand it; neither could
any of the other operators; for we used to drag off my impromptu
automatic recorder and hide it when our toil was over. But the
crash came when there was a big night&#8217;s work&mdash;a presidential
vote, I think it was&mdash;and copy kept pouring in at the top rate
of speed, until we fell an hour and a half or two hours behind.
The newspapers sent in frantic complaints, an investigation was
made, and our little scheme was discovered. We couldn&#8217;t use
it any more.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was that same rude automatic recorder,&#8221; Edison explained,
&#8220;that indirectly&mdash;yet not by accident, but by logical deduction&mdash;led
me long afterward to invent the phonograph. I&#8217;ll tell you
how this came about. After thinking over the matter a great
deal, I came to the point where, in 1877, I had worked out satisfactorily
an instrument which would not only record telegrams
by indenting a strip of paper with dots and dashes of the Morse
code, but would also repeat a message any number of times at
any rate of speed required. I was then experimenting with the
telephone also, and my mind was filled with theories of sound
vibrations and their transmission by diaphragms. Naturally
enough, the idea occurred to me: If the indentations on paper
could be made to give forth again the click of the instrument, why
could not the vibrations of a diaphragm be recorded and similarly
reproduced? I rigged up an instrument hastily, and pulled a strip
of paper through it, at the same time shouting, &#8216;Hallo!&#8217; Then the
paper was pulled through again, my friend Batchelor and I listening
breathlessly. We heard a distinct sound, which a strong
imagination might have translated into the original &#8216;Hallo!&#8217; That
was enough to lead me to a further experiment. But Batchelor
was sceptical, and bet me a barrel of apples that I couldn&#8217;t make
the thing go. I made a drawing of a model, and took it to Mr.
Kruesi, at that time engaged on piece-work for me. I marked it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
$4, and told him it was a talking machine. He grinned, thinking
it a joke; but set to work, and soon had the model ready. I arranged
some tin-foil on it, and spoke into the machine. Kruesi
looked on, and was still grinning. But when I arranged the
machine for transmission, and we both heard a distinct sound
from it, he nearly fell down in his fright; I was a little scared
myself, I must admit. I won that barrel of apples from Batchelor,
though, and was mighty glad to get it.&#8221;</p>

<h3>The Latest Phonograph.</h3>

<p>In October, 1905, I paid Mr. Edison a visit at his laboratory,
when he showed me the phonograph as now perfected. Chief
among his improvements is a composition for
records which is much harder than the wax
formerly employed, and may therefore revolve
more swiftly with no fear of blurring. His reproducer is to-day
a built-up diaphragm of mica, highly sensitive. In the reproducer
arm is placed the highly polished, button-shaped sapphire which
tracks with fidelity the grooves which sound has recorded on the
cylinder. These features, combined in a mechanism of the utmost
accuracy in make and adjustment, have opened for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
phonograph a vast field in the business world. Some of the great
firms and companies of New York and other cities now use
phonographs instead of stenographers; a letter or a contract is
dictated to a revolving cylinder with all the swiftness of ordinary
speech. Afterward a secretary listens to the reproducer and
writes the letter or contract at any speed desired. On occasion
a cylinder bearing a message may be sent to a correspondent who
listens to its words as sent forth from his own phonograph, no
intermediate writing being required. Such instruments are extensively
used in teaching foreign languages, learners being free
to have a difficult pronunciation repeated until it is mastered.
Mr. Edison has much improved the musical records familiar
throughout the world; these are now produced in molds of gold
with a delicacy that refines away the scratchiness of tone so unpleasant
in earlier cylinders.</p>

<h3>Telephone Messages Recorded for Repetition at Will: The Telegraphone.</h3>

<p>As the fruit of rare experimental ability Mr. Valdemar Poulsen,
an electrical engineer of Copenhagen, has invented the
telegraphone. This instrument proceeds upon
the fact that the electrical pulses of the telephone,
minute and delicate though they are,
can register themselves magnetically upon a
moving steel wire but one-hundredth of an
inch in diameter. The message is repeated as
often as the wire is borne between the poles of an electro-magnet
in circuit with a telephonic receiver. The accompanying <a href="#Fig208">figure</a>
shows the transmitter, the traveling wire, and the receiver as it
repeats a message. The instrument in its latest form is <a href="#Fig208a">illustrated</a>
opposite page 314. In supplementing the telephone most
usefully, this apparatus brings a fresh competition to bear upon
the telegraph. In many cases a man of business has preferred
to telegraph rather than to telephone a message, because a
telegram as a written record affords proof in case of error or dispute.
Now suppose that through a telegraphone a broker offers
six per cent. interest for a loan; his voice impressed on the wire,
duly preserved for reference, identifies him as securely as would
his signature on a written offer. Take a different case: a patient
rings up a physician only to find him not at home; a message
committed to a few yards of wire is listened to by the physician<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
the moment he returns to his office. Take an example of yet another
service: a letter may be dictated at Newark and recorded
on a wire in Brooklyn, and there, at leisure, be put upon paper
by an amanuensis. Or, better still, the message may be spoken
upon a small, revolving disc of steel, and mailed to a correspondent
who listens to its words as they roll out of his own
graphophone. Young children and others unable to write may
impress discs that tell their story to correspondents unable to
read. So compact withal are the records of this instrument that
they may soon give us not only music from the concert-room, and
news from the telegraph office, but also the latest popular book.</p>

<p>A wire or a disc can repeat its record, vocal or musical, hundreds
of times without loss of distinctness. To obliterate this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
record it only is necessary to pass the steel between the poles of
a strong magnet.</p>

<h3>The Gray Telautograph.</h3>

<p>A telephone transmits a familiar voice so that its tones are at
once recognized. By electrical means a telautograph reproduces
writing at a distance so precisely that it may
be as readily identified. To understand how
this feat is accomplished let us begin with the
transmission of vertical marks varying in length.</p>

<div class="figc600" id="Fig209">
<img src="images/illo363.png" alt="" width="600" height="515" />
<p class="caption">A, sending a vertical line S M by electricity.<br />
B, sending a horizontal line S M by electricity.</p>
</div>

<p>This task, as above <a href="#Fig209">illustrated</a>, we perform by sending to a
receiving pencil a current varying in strength between limits
which correspond to the variations in length of our transmitted
lines. The strength of this current, say 0.429 volt, decides where
a mark will begin; the strength of that current in rising to say 27.5
volts, decides where that mark will end. To vary the strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
of the current as desired we employ a square rod of aluminium,
tightly covered with a thin copper wire insulated by silk wrapping.
We place this rod beside our tablet, and scrape from its innermost
surface the silk covering so as to leave the wire bare, while
between its strands the silk remains intact as an effective insulation.
Our rod is now a rheostat, whose use we shall presently
discover. We are wont to think of copper as a good conductor,
and so it is. Used in stout bars or thick wires it exerts but little
resistance to an electric current, but when we employ a wire of
but <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>200</sub> of an inch in diameter, about the thickness of the paper
on which this is printed, the narrowness of path reduces the
pressure of a current so much that in the course of 375 feet it
falls to one eighth. In like manner a glass tube of minute diameter
might receive at one end water under extreme pressure,
and at a yard distance send out a mere dribble. The copper wire
of our square rod, or rheostat, is so thin that when connected at
K with a source of 110-volt electricity, at V this voltage, or
pressure, has sunk to but one twentieth of a volt.</p>

<p>Let us suppose our rheostat at V connected with a circuit extended
to the receiving station. A wire, kept in this circuit, and
moving up and down with our pencil, in a line always parallel
with the side of our tablet, sends to the receiving station a current
constantly varying in its pressure. As the wire passes from
S to M the transmitted current rises from 0.429 to 27.5 volts.</p>

<p>At the receiving station we provide means whereby the current
arriving at a voltage of 0.429 and rising to 27.5 will mark a
vertical line the length of S M. A simple device for this purpose
consists in a hollow coil of copper wire, or a solenoid, as electricians
call it, through which circulates the arriving current, the
coil being free to be drawn as a shell over a cylindrical electro-magnet.
The degree to which such a coil, duly attached to a retractile
spring, is drawn over a suitable electro-magnet, depends
upon the strength of the current circulating in the coil. In the
simple instrument we are using let us assume that when a current
of 110 volts comes in, the coil moves to K, the end of its path;
that when a current of 6.875 volts arrives, the coil moves to O;
the receiving coil and the sending rheostat being marked with
the same divisions. Our receiving coil actuates a pencil which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
accordingly marks a line of the same length and direction as that
set down on the tablet of the sending instrument.</p>

<p>Let us next transmit between these two stations a series of
horizontal lines. To do this we duplicate our first apparatus. We
place a second rheostat along the foot of our sending tablet, not
along its side, and slide a second wire along its bared surface
with motions always parallel to those of the marking pencil. Thus
a second current, going by a wire of its own to the receiving
station there repeats through a second coil, or solenoid, the horizontal
marks of our sending pencil.</p>

<p>We have now two sets of apparatus, alike in all respects, one
sending rheostat at right angles to the other; one receiving
solenoid at right angles to its mate. In the actual telautograph
the rheostats are curved, as shown in the picture facing page 318,
and they are so joined by levers that the up-and-down and sidewise
motions of writing are accurately represented, from moment
to moment, in the two varying currents sent afar. As these currents
arrive they actuate a pencil, similarly furnished with levers,
so that it moves in a path which exactly corresponds with that of
the sending pencil. The apparatus has an ingenious ink supply,
and a device to shift the paper as filled line after line. In its basic
features the telautograph was invented by the late Professor
Elisha Gray of Chicago. Its present form is largely due to the
modifications and additions of Mr. George S. Tiffany of New
York. The instrument is giving satisfactory service in thousands
of banks, factories, hotels, business offices, and households.
Its records at both ends of a line make it of inestimable value in
many cases, as aboard a warship where orders of the utmost importance
may be committed to its tablets. <a href="#Fig209a">Exterior</a> and <a href="#Fig209b">interior</a>
views of the instrument are given facing page 318.</p>

<h3>Machines Cannot Directly Imitate  Hands: A Task Must be &#8220;Coded.&#8221;</h3>

<p>Only a few machines deal with writing or its duplication, most
machines perform quite other tasks at first wrought by the
hands. Inventors have always gone astray
when they have sought to imitate a hand process
with anything like precision. On this
point Sir John Fletcher Moulton, of London,
says<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;Doubtless you have often had to send
a message by telegraph to some distant country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
to which the rate charged per word is high. You write your message
as tersely as may be, but even thus its length is formidable.
You resort to your telegraphic code. It tells you that if you will
change the phraseology of your message you can by a single
code-word represent a whole phrase. You thereupon set to work
to recast your message so as to make it capable of being expressed
in code-words. When you have done so, you have not improved
it as a message. It is less terse and less naturally expressed. If
you were writing and not telegraphing, you would prefer to use
it in its original form. But as now expressed, each of the phrases
of which it is composed can be sent over the wires in the form
and at the price of a single word, and the cost of the whole is but
a fraction of what would have been the cost of the message as
originally framed. It has been cast in a form suitable for cheap
telegraphing. Just so with the inventor. He has to find a series
of operations which, in their totality, are equivalent to the series
of the hand worker. But each of these operations in itself need
not be such as would in hand labor be suitable or even practicable.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is necessary and sufficient for him that they are suited to
the new conditions, so that they can be well and easily done by
mechanism, and that, taken as a whole, they produce the same
result as the series which he is paralleling. He is re-writing the
series in terms suited to mechanism just as the message was rewritten
in terms suited for telegraphing. The meaning of
the message must remain the same, but the terms used to express
it are no longer those most naturally used in writing or speaking,
but are those which can be telegraphed at least cost.</p>

<h3>Sewing Coded in a Machine.</h3>

<p>&#8220;To make my meaning clear, let me revert to the familiar
operation of sewing. The hand process is plainly unsuited for
mechanical reproduction. How is it to be
translated into an equivalent cycle suitable for
mechanism? In other words, how is it to be
&#8216;coded&#8217;? This case is interesting, inasmuch as
we have two independent solutions worked out at different dates
and widely different in nature. The earlier invention imitated the
hand cycle very closely. The thumb and finger of the right hand
in the human being were replaced by pairs of pincers capable of
taking hold of the needle and letting it free again, but to avoid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
having to follow the intricate movements of the human fingers
in the operation two pairs of pincers were used, one on each side
of the work, which passed the needle backwards and forwards
through the fabric one to the other. Following out this idea the
needle was pointed at both ends with an eye in the middle, and,
as in hand sewing, it carried a moderate length of thread. The
pair of pincers which held the threaded needle advanced to the
fabric and passed through it to the other pair which took it and
retreated so as to draw the thread tight and form the completed
stitch. To form the next stitch the work was moved through the
proper distance and the same process was gone through, the line
of movement of the needle always remaining the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is not much &#8216;coding&#8217; here. The new cycle imitates the
hand-worker so faithfully that it benefits little by the advantages
of mechanical action. As in hand work it can only sew with
moderate lengths of thread, and must therefore have the needles
re-threaded at intervals. Its superiority over hand labor is therefore
so slight that it is doubtful whether such a sewing machine
could ever have competed with, much less replaced, hand work.
But it has one great merit. The needle mechanism is capable of
being re-duplicated almost without limit, and the movement of the
work which is necessary to direct the stitches for one needle will
serve equally well for any number of needles working parallel to
it. Hence the machine that would have failed as a sewing machine
has survived and proved useful as an embroidery machine.
The work is stretched between two rows of pincers and moved
by the workman according to the stitches of the pattern. Each
stitch is repeated by each of the parallel needles which work side
by side at convenient distances, and thus as many copies of the pattern
are simultaneously produced as there are needles. Each is a
perfect facsimile of all the others, and as each copies faithfully
the errors of the workman, this machine is entitled to the proud
boast that its productions possess all the defects of hand work&mdash;an
essential we are told of artistic beauty.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the cause of the comparative failure of this attempt
at a sewing-machine? It is evident that it is due to the retention
of the feature of the hand operation by which the needle is passed
from one holding mechanism to the other. The inventors of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
modern sewing-machine on the one hand decided to work with a
needle fixed in its holder and never leaving it throughout the
operation. It at once followed that the needle and thread must,
on the back stroke, return through the same hole through which
they had entered the fabric, so that no stitch could be formed unless
some obstacle were interposed to the return of the thread.
Here the two famous and successful forms of the machine parted
company. Both placed the eye at the point of the needle that the
stroke might not be needlessly long, but while the lock stitch
machine used a second thread to provide the necessary obstacle,
the chain stitch machine availed itself of a loop of the original
thread for that purpose. Thus in the lock stitch machine the substituted
cycle became as follows<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) The work is moved under the needle for the new stroke.</p>

<p class="list">(2) The needle (which has an eye at its point through which
the thread passes) pierces the fabric carrying with it the thread.</p>

<p class="list">(3) A second thread is passed between the thread and the
needle (by means of a shuttle or its equivalent) when the needle
is at its lowest position.</p>

<p class="list">(4) The needle returns while a take-up retracts the thread so
as to tighten the stitch.</p>

<p>&#8220;This cycle would, for hand work, be immeasurably more complicated
and difficult than ordinary sewing, but it consists of
operations mechanically easy of performance in swift and accurately
timed sequence, and as the whole of the thread in use has
no longer to be passed from one side of the fabric to the other as
each stitch is made, it has brought with it the all-important advantage
of our being able to work with a continuous thread.
Here, then, is a magnificent example of &#8216;coding.&#8217; It is not to be
wondered at that the machines which it has given to the world
are in well-nigh universal use, and have profoundly modified
both our social and industrial economy.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Obed Hussey and His Mower.</h3>

<p>One of the supreme inventions of all time is the mower of Obed
Hussey, of Maryland, devised in 1833, and afterward adapted to
reaping. In the primitive reaping of tall grain
one hand keeps the stalks upright, while the
other hand cuts these stalks with a scythe.
Hussey, in a masterpiece of &#8220;coding,&#8221; arrayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
metal fingers which keep the grain from bending, while vibrating
knives sever the stalks. To this day his invention remains the
core of millions of mowers as well as reapers; it has economized
labor to an extent beyond estimate,
and by shortening the time required
in harvesting has saved many million
bushels of grain which otherwise
would have been destroyed by bad
weather.</p>

<div class="figc350" id="Fig210">
<img src="images/illo371.png" alt="" width="350" height="372" />
<p class="caption">Obed Hussey&#8217;s mower
or reaper.</p>
</div>

<p>Not a few inventors of the first
mark are found among the men of
great ability who unite training in two
distinct fields of science, whose alliances
they thoughtfully cultivate.</p>

<h3>New Modes of Attack.</h3>

<p>Thus Helmholtz, at once a physician
and a physicist, devised the ophthalmoscope,
that simple instrument for observing the interior of the
eye. On a plane less lofty an inventor&#8217;s success may turn on his
width of outlook, his intimacy with fields
remote from the home acre, so that he may
gainfully ally two arts or processes that, to
a casual glance, seem utterly unrelated or unrelatable. When
a pneumatic tube between a post-office and a railroad station
is obstructed, there would seem to be no promise of aid in a
fire-arm. But snapping off its blank cartridge at the open end of
the tube gives back an echo through the air within the tube; in
measuring the interval between touching the trigger and hearing
the echo, there is news as to where the tube is choked, the velocity
of sound in air being known. From the labors of a postmaster
let us turn to those of an apothecary, who pounds and grinds his
drugs in a mortar which has descended from the day when it
reduced grain to flour. The grindstones which succeeded the
mortar were only in recent years ousted by Hungarian rollers of
steel which separate the constituents of grain with a new perfection.
Their excellence consists in imitating the crushing of
the mortar, not in attempting the grinding of the familiar burrs.</p>

<p>The miller&#8217;s practice in one particular has given the postmaster
a hint of value. In a flour-mill a cheap and sufficient motor is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
simple gravity as the products pass from one machine to the next.
At the very outset the wheat is taken by conveyors to the top
floor, whence its products descend, stage by stage, impelled by
gravity alone, until the finished and barreled flour rolls into shipping
rooms beside the railroad tracks. This principle has been
adopted at the Chicago Post-office, where the mails as received
are borne to the top floor, thence, by gravity, they take their way
as sorted and re-sorted, to the ground floor where they are finally
disposed of.</p>

<p>In a field somewhat parallel is the modern art of designing the
layout of a great manufacturing plant so that the material shall
travel as little as possible between its entrance and its exit. In a
well planned ship-yard the machines are so placed that the steel
plates, bars and girders, the planks and boards, move continuously
from one machine to its neighbor, ending at last by reaching the
building berth.</p>

<p>Shears for metal, cutting scissors-fashion, have long been
familiar; the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad employs
the Murphy machine, on the same principle, to cut up old
ties and bridge timbers intended for fuel. The upper moving
blade is set about an inch out of line from the lower fixed blade,
so as to allow spikes or bolts to pass through without injuring
the machine. In dividing cord wood for stoves and furnaces a
machine of this kind might be used instead of a saw.</p>

<p>It is by perfect means of subdivision that new and cheap
materials for writing and printing are now produced. The leaves
offered by the papyrus to scribes were used for centuries, so that
the plant has given its name to paper now made from fibres of
cotton, linen, or wood, finely divided, thoroughly mixed, and
squeezed between rollers much as if paste. Paper from its
smoothness, its absence of grain and its low price, is far preferable
to papyrus leaves or vellum. Its manufacture has been
copied in diverse new industries. Wood ground to powder,
worked into pulp, molded into pails, tubs and the like, is saturated
with oil to produce wares of indurated fibre. A pail thus
manufactured will not split apart in dry weather when empty, or
absorb liquids, and it is as easily kept clean as glass.</p>

<p>While wood has thus found a rival in pulp, stone has a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
competitor much more formidable. Pavements and piers are
often needed in long stretches, without joints for the admission
of rain or frost. The demand is met by cements and concretes
easily laid in unjointed miles. These materials when strengthened
with skeletons of steel find many uses; a brief <a href="#Page_429">survey</a> of them is
given in this book. A sister product, terra cotta, baked at high
temperatures, is now molded in beautiful designs not only for
tiles, but as walls, cornices, finials, vases, hearths, and statuary.</p>

</div>

<h3>Linotype and Its Use of Wedges.</h3>

<p>Clay as tablets was one of the first mediums of the printer&#8217;s
art, an art of late years exposed to many a surprise from unexpected
invaders. Composition is now performed
by machines of various models, one of them
being Mergenthaler&#8217;s linotype, as employed for
this book. In effect this machine is a caster
rather than a compositor, and recalls the chief tasks of the type-foundry.
As an operator touches its keys he releases a succession
of matrices, from which is cast a line as a unit. In its latest form
this machine enables the operator to change instantly from one
font to another, introducing roman, italic, and black face type in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
the same line at will. Intricate book, tabular and pamphlet matter,
with chapter headings, titles, or marginal notes may in this
new model be set up at a speed four to six times quicker than
hand composition.</p>

<div class="figc300" id="Fig212">

<p class="caption">J. W. Schuckers&#8217; double-wedge
justifier.</p>
</div>

<p>An <a href="#Fig211">illustration</a> shows the two-letter matrices of a special Mergenthaler
machine. The upper is usually a body character and
the lower an italic, a small capital or a black face. These lower
matrices are lifted a little by a key so as to come in line with upper
matrices. In this way the compositor has at command two
distinct fonts. Groove E receives the ears of the matrices. In a
normal position D receives the ears of the matrices elevated to
produce the secondary characters. In this way the matrices are
held in position as casting proceeds. Five double-wedge justifiers
will be observed between the matrices. These devices, invented
by J. W. Schuckers, form an essential
part of the machine. Justification,
let the reader be reminded, is so
spacing the contents of a line that it
shall neatly end with a word or syllable.
In typewritten manuscript the
lack of justification leaves the ends
of lines jagged and unsightly. Mr.
Schuckers at the end of every word
places a pair of wedges. When the
operator is close to the end of a
line he pushes in the whole row of
wedges in that line; the outer
sides of each pair remain always parallel, and as pushed in these
outer sides are just sufficiently forced apart to space out the line
with exactitude. To lift a table or a desk, and at the same time
keep it always level, we may use pairs of wedges in the same
manner; they must, of course, be much larger and thicker than
those used in linotypy. See next page for an <a href="#Fig213">illustration</a>.</p>

<p>To-day a book may be reproduced without any recourse whatever
to the type long indispensable. A photographer takes the
volume, and repeats it in pages of any size we wish, dispensing
not only with the type-setter or the type-caster, but even with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
the proofreader, since a camera furnishes an exact <i>fac-simile</i> of
the original work. If the book is illustrated, a further economy
is enjoyed; its pictures are copied as faithfully and cheaply as the
letterpress.</p>

<h3>Ingenuity in Copying and Decorating.</h3>

<p>A feat which is a mere trifle as compared with reproducing a
book by photography, turns upon a loan from an old resource.
Confectioners from time immemorial have
squeezed paste out of bags through apertures
into ornaments for wedding cakes and the
like. With similar bags decorators force a
thin stream of plaster into a semblance of flowers, fruits, and
arabesques on their ceilings and cornices. On the same plan,
with pressure more severe, soap is forced, from a tank through a
square opening to form bars for the laundress. Increasing the
pressure once again, clay for bricks is urged forth, to be divided
into lengths suitable for the kiln. Lead pipe is manufactured on
the same principle, recalling the production of macaroni. A
further step was taken by Alexander Dick, the inventor of Delta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
metal; by employing hydraulic pressure on metals at red heat he
poured out wires and bars of varied cross-sections, superseding
the method of drawing through dies.</p>

<h3>Frost as a Servant.</h3>

<p>Cold as well as heat may be employed in a novel manner. The
flesh of birds, beasts, and insects is now frozen hard, so as to be
sliced into extremely thin sections clearly showing
the details of structure. How a freezing
process may aid the miner was shown first in
Germany in 1880, when Hermann Poetsch, a mining engineer,
had to sink a shaft near Aschersleben, to a vein of coal, where,
after excavating 100 feet, a stratum of sand eighteen feet thick,
overlying the coal, was encountered. It occurred to Poetsch that
the great difficulty occasioned by the influx of water through the
sand could be overcome by solidifying the entire mass by freezing.
To do this, he penetrated the sand to be excavated with large pipes
eight inches in diameter, sunk entirely through it and a foot or
two into the underlying coal. These were placed in a circle at
intervals of a metre, and close to the periphery of the shaft. They
were closed at the lower end. Inside each of these and open at its
lower end was a pipe an inch in diameter. This system of pipes
was so connected that a closed circulation could be produced
down through the small pipes and up through the large ones. An
ice-machine, such as brewers use, was set up near by and kept at
a temperature below zero Fahrenheit. A tank filled with a solution
of chloride of magnesium, which freezes at -40&deg; Fahr., had
its contents circulated through the ground pipes described.
Thermometers placed in pipes sunk in the mass of sand showed
51.8&deg; Fahr. at the beginning of the process. The circulation was
kept up and on the third day the whole mass was frozen. Within
the continuous frozen wall the material was excavated without
damage from caving in or inflow of water. The freezing entered
the coal three feet, and to a distance six feet outside the pipes.
The circulation was kept up until the excavation and walling were
complete. On a somewhat similar plan tunnels have been bored
through difficult ground. Of late years at Detroit, and elsewhere,
serious breaks in water-mains have been repaired after a freezing
process has solidified the stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<h3>Polarized Light and X-Rays.</h3>

<p>Light, as well as heat and cold, is to-day bidden to perform
new duties. It was long ago observed that polarized light as it
takes its way through transparent crystal or glass clearly reveals
in areas of variegation, any strains to which the crystal or glass
may be subjected. Of late this fact has been applied with new
skill to investigating strains in engineering structures. A model
in glass, carefully annealed, is placed in the path of a beam of
polarized light. By shifting the points of application
and of support, by loading the structure
more or less, and here or there, the distribution
of stresses and strains is directly shown to the
eye. In this way curved shapes of various kinds have been investigated,
as well as bodies in which Hooke&#8217;s law of the strict
proportionality of strain to stress does not apply. Photographs
taken by this method show
the distribution of stresses
in rings subjected to external
compression, crank
shafts, and car-coupler
hooks. It would be interesting
thus to compare standard
types of girders, trusses,
and bridges, as well as
arches of various forms,
both regular and skew.</p>

<div class="figc350" id="Fig214">
<img src="images/illo377.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="201" />
<p class="caption">Polarized light showing strains in glass.</p>
</div>

<p>Polarized light, which when first discovered seemed nothing
more than a singular and quite sterile phenomenon, has other uses
of great importance. It tells the chemist how much sugar a given
solution contains; it displays the inner architecture of rocks when
these are sawn into thin sections.</p>

<p>Even more valuable than polarized light are the X-rays discovered
by Professor R&ouml;ntgen. One of their latest uses is to
reveal impurities and air bubbles in electric cables, affording a
procedure much simpler and easier than to employ electrical instruments.
In the production of X-rays and similar rays a tube
as nearly vacuous as possible is employed. As an aid in removing
air Professor James Dewar, of Cambridge University, has recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
adopted cocoanut charcoal with remarkable success. He subjects
it to the intense cold of liquid air, then establishing communication
between a receptacle filled with this charcoal and a bulb exhausted
to one fourth of the ordinary atmospheric pressure, he
has air so tenuous that an electric spark passes through it with
difficulty. So much for developing the long known affinity of
charcoal for gases, a property which increases in degree as temperatures
fall.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />
AUTOMATICITY AND INITIATION</h2>

<p class="chaptoc">Self-acting devices abridge labor .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Trigger effects in the laboratory,
the studio, and the workshop .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Automatic telephones .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Equilibrium
of the atmosphere may be easily upset.</p>

<p class="chapstart">At this place we may for a little while consider a few fundamental
principles of construction whereby inventors have
economized material, labor and energy by making their devices
self-acting, and by so poising a contrivance that a mere touch at
the right time and place sets it going.</p>

<h3>Steam Engines.</h3>

<p>Humphrey Potter was a boy whose duty obliged him to open
and shut the valves of a Newcomen steam-engine as it slowly
went its rounds. He was a human sort of boy,
who liked play better than his irksome task, so
he found a way to rid himself of the drudgery
of constantly moving his valve-handles to and fro. He tied a rod
to the walking beam in such wise that it opened the valve at the
proper moment, and, at another point in its circuit, when necessary,
closed it. Then and only then did the steam-engine become
self-acting. In the best modern types of engine this automaticity
goes far indeed. Not only does the mechanism pump water as
required into both the boiler and the condenser, it shuts off steam
instantly when the engine moves too swiftly, and, when the engine
speed is sluggish the port betwixt boiler and cylinders is opened
to the full. And further: automatic stokers bear coal into the
furnace at a rate which varies with the demand, should the steam
pressure fall through an undue call for power, then an extra
quantity of coal is borne upon the grate-bars. When oil is the fuel
automatic stoking is, of course, at its best, there being neither
cinders nor ashes to be removed&mdash;a duty, by the way, which in
large central stations requires extensive machinery, all automatic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<h3>Self-winding Clocks.</h3>

<p>The essence of automaticity is that mechanism at a certain, predetermined
point in an operation shall perform a required act.
Thus, to take the common example of a striking
clock: at the end of each hour a detent is pulled
so as to release a hammer which hits a gong the
proper number of times. Let us suppose the clock to be driven by
a weight or a spring in the ordinary way; every day or every week
the weight or spring will require to be wound up. In time-pieces
of a new variety the period during which no attention whatever is
needed is lengthened to a year. The Self-winding Clock Company,
of Brooklyn, New York, makes a clock which is driven by
a fine spring, much like a common clock; that spring every hour
is automatically wound up by a tiny electric motor connected with
a small battery in the clock case. An attachment is provided by
which, through the wires of the Western Union Telegraph Company,
the clock is every hour regulated to the standard time of the
National Observatory at Washington. The charge for this service
is one dollar a month.</p>

<h3>Looms and Presses.</h3>

<p>To-day a designer always seeks to make a machine self-acting,
to limit the operator&#8217;s task to starting, directing, and stopping, all
with the utmost facility and the least possible
exertion. So far has success gone in this direction
that a single tender in a cotton-mill may
have charge of sixteen Northrop looms, and go to dinner leaving
all at work. In case that a thread breaks in any of them, the loom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
will stop of itself and no harm will be done, the only loss consisting
in the time during which the wheels and levers have lain idle.
A stop-motion at its simplest is a fork through which the thread
travels; as the thread moves forward, the fork is bent downward
extending a light coiled spring; should the thread break, the spring
instantly lifts the fork, which in rising stops the machine.</p>

<p>Among the most noteworthy automatic machines are the presses
which take a continuous roll of paper, print both sides, cut it into
leaves, fold these, paste them at the back, and, if desired, sew them
together and attach a cover. Such a press stands for the union of
several operations once distinct; it argues great ingenuity, careful
planning, with paper exactly adapted to the stresses it must encounter,
while the ink is of a quick-drying variety.</p>

<h3>The Dexter Feeding Mechanism.</h3>

<p>Binding operations and a good deal of printing have to deal
with separate sheets of paper or card. To feed these to presses,
folders or binders was for many years a task
for the hand. To-day the Dexter Folder Company,
of New York, in a diversity of machines
supersedes this toil by an ingenious imitation of
manual movements. The uppermost sheet of paper in a pile is for
a moment held down at A by a rubber finger, during that moment
a small rubber roller B slightly buckles the sheet; at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
an airblast lifts the sheet from its pile; that done, all in a twinkling,
finger A rises and the sheet passes either into a press or a folding
machine. So nicely limited is the pathway for the paper that no
more than one sheet can pass at a time; if two or more sheets
present themselves, the feeding mechanism stops, bringing the
press or folder to a standstill. As each sheet passes from under
the rubber fingers, the table bearing the pile of paper is lifted by
just one thickness of paper.</p>

<h3>Self-Acting Appliances in Metallurgy.</h3>

<p>Mr. James Douglas, president of the Copper Queen Company,
New York, thus describes automatic devices in metallurgy: &#8220;The
gold mill, with its series of automatic operations,
is the offspring of Californian ingenuity.
In it manual labor is almost entirely replaced by
ocular labor, for superintendence and not work
is the function of the mill-hands. The ore, dumped into the
breakers, falls into large pockets, whence it slides into automatic
feeders, which supply the stamps with regulated quantities. The
free gold is partly extracted by liquid mercury in the mortars, and
by copper plates attached to their sides, and partly on an apron of
amalgamated copper plates, over which crushed pulp flows as it
issues from the battery screen. Automatic vanners receive the
tailings, separate the sulphurets, and discharge the waste. When
the power is water, the stream is divided to Pelton wheels, coupled
to the separate groups or even pieces of machinery. The absence
of intermediate running gear increases not only the sense, but the
reality of automaticity, and makes a skilfully arranged and thoroughly
equipped Californian mill one of the triumphs of modern
mechanical metallurgy.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Directive Paths.</h3>

<p>An interesting field of ingenuity concerns itself with giving
work the right start and a simple path. A tear in a sheet of paper
accurately follows the line of a directive crease.
Postage stamps, small as they are, we readily
detach from one another because perforations
give direction to the tearing strain. So the quarryman takes care
to cut a V-shaped groove in the rock he is to break, along which
groove the break takes its way. A bolt when over-strained will
break in the thread, whether this be the smallest section or not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
because the thread is a starting point for a parting. A rod of
glass is divided with a slight jar, provided that a groove has been
filed in its surface. In all this there is shown the importance of
avoiding in a casting, or forging, such minute cracks as under
severe strain may lead to rupture.</p>

<h3>The Pianola.</h3>

<p>Within the past ten years automatic musical instruments have
been much improved and are now well established in public favor.
Not a few teachers of mark use them in their
schools as a means of familiarizing their pupils
with the best music. All these instruments afford
an opportunity for expression on a performer&#8217;s part; the effects
producible by a practiced performer are remarkable, and give
color to the prediction that automatic music may have a parallel
history with that of the photograph, which has at last attained a
truth and beauty which bring it to a rivalry with the art of the
painter.</p>

<p>From the educational series issued by the &AElig;olian Company,
New York, a few notes from Schumann&#8217;s &#8220;Traumerei&#8221; are here
given, together with these notes as they appear on a music roll for
the Pianola.</p>

<p class="caption">First notes of the &#8220;Traumerei&#8221; on a Pianola roll.</p>
</div>

<p>A Pianola is operated by suction, through the exhaustion of air
from a bellows normally distended by springs as shown in 5 in the
accompanying <a href="#Fig218">illustration</a>. The exhauster is operated by the
pedal 1; the board 3, with its small bellows, exhausts the air from
5 in the chest 7 by a series of valves not shown in detail. When
the air is pumped from 5 by the motion of exhauster 3, this bellows
collapses notwithstanding the retractile spring 6. The exhaust
condition may now operate upon any chamber of the whole
mechanism through trunk 7 and pipe 8. When a perforation in a
music sheet 16 passes over its corresponding duct in tracker 15,
air is admitted through tube 14, which relieves the diaphragm in
chamber 9, made of a very thin piece of leather, upon which rests
the stem of valve 11. Owing to the suction in chamber 9 this
diaphragm instantly raises and shuts the outer port 23 by means
of valve 11, giving a free communication from pipe 8 through
chambers 9 and 12, to the striking pneumatic 13 which collapses,
and through pitman 19 and finger 20 strikes the key. As soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
the unperforated part of the music sheet has passed over the hole
15 in the trackerboard, the flow of air through pipe 14 is cut off
and the pressure on the small diaphragm in chamber 9 has ceased
to be operative, and valve 11 immediately drops and allows air to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
pass into striking pneumatic 13, through port 23, so that pneumatic
13 and the key levers come back to their normal positions.</p>

<h3>Automatic Telephones.</h3>

<p>Much self-acting machinery employs electricity. By virtue of
this wonderful agent the Automatic Electric Company of Chicago
instals telephonic systems which enable a subscriber
to connect himself directly with any
other subscriber, without the intervention of an
operator at the central station. As exemplified in large exchanges
such as those of Dayton, Ohio, and Grand Rapids, Michigan, the
apparatus is complex in its detail. If we take a small exchange,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336-<br />337]</a><br /><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a></span>
such as that of a village with 100 instruments, we may readily
understand the main principles of the method. Let us suppose
that No. 1 of our instruments is at the Post Office, where the
Postmaster wishes to call 58. With a finger he moves hole 5 in the
dial plate of his <a href="#Fig218a">calling instrument</a> (see the page opposite 336)
until it touches a protruding stud. Then he lets go, when the dial
returns to its original position. In returning it sends five impulses
to the central office where a vertical rod is lifted five notches (see
<a href="#Fig218">illustration</a>, page 336.) He next moves hole 8 to the stud and lets
go. This time the rod turns through a considerable part of its
semicircle of motion. The instant its journey is at an end a tiny
metallic arm flies out and connection is completed with a wire running
to 58, ringing his bell. In case he is busy, a buzzing noise
will be heard in telephone No. 1. The switch mechanism which
comes into play in all this is simple. There are ten rows of
switches, ten in each row: the lowest row runs from 1 to 10, the
next from 11 to 20, and so on. The upward motion of the vertical
rod in our example brought it to the fifties; the turning motion
decided that out of these fifties switch 58 should be connected
with No. 1. When a conversation ends, hanging up the receiver
sends a current over both wires of the circuit so as to release the
selector rod, which returns to its original position.</p>

<p>If instead of a village we have a fairly large town, with an exchange
of 1000 subscribers, a call for let us say 829 will involve
taking to the stud first hole 8, then hole 2, and lastly hole 9. And
so on for exchanges still larger. The pioneer inventor in automatic
telephony was the late Mr. Almon B. Strowger.</p>

<h3>Chemical Triggers.</h3>

<p>From triggers electrical we now pass to triggers chemical. A
gun may be charged with powder and remain for years perfectly
at rest until a touch on the trigger explodes the
powder with tremendous effect. The example
is typical: nature and art abound with cases
where a little energy, rightly directed, controls energy vastly, perhaps
infinitely, greater in quantity. Often in a chemical compound
the poise of attraction is so delicate that it may be disturbed by a
breath, or by a note from a fiddle, as when either of these induces
iodide of nitrogen to explode. A beam of light works the same
result with a mixture of chlorine and hydrogen. One of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
familiar facts of chemistry is that a fuel, such as coal, may remain
intact in air for ages. Once let a fragment of it be brought to
flaming heat and all the rest of the mass will take fire too. Iron
has a strong affinity for oxygen, but for union there must be at
the beginning some moisture with the gas; the same is true of
carbon. A burning jet of carbon monoxide may be extinguished
by plunging it into a jar of dried oxygen. Gases from the throat
of a blast furnace, at a temperature of 250&deg; to 300&deg; Centigrade,
are not inflammable in the atmosphere until the air is moistened by
steam or otherwise. Then in a flash combustion begins in earnest.</p>

<p>In photography we meet with similar facts: violet rays may
begin an impression which yellow light can finish and finish only.
Vulcanite is transparent to red and infra-red rays which, although
without action upon an unexposed plate, are capable of continuing
the action of actinic rays upon a plate which has been exposed for
a very short time.</p>

<h3>Why Weather is Uncertain.</h3>

<p>From photography let us pass to a glance at the atmospheric
conditions which greatly affect its work. The weather from day to
day depends upon factors so variable and unstable
that prediction beyond twenty-four hours
is unsafe. &#8220;Suppose a stratum of air,&#8221; says
Professor Balfour Stewart, &#8220;to be very nearly
saturated with aqueous vapor; that is to say, to be just a little
above the dew-point; while at the same time it is losing heat but
slowly, so that if left to itself it would be a long time before
moisture were deposited. Now such a stratum is in a very delicate
state of molecular equilibrium, and the dropping into it of a small
crystal of snow would at once cause a remarkable change. The
snow would cool the air around it, and thus moisture would be
deposited around the snowflake in the form of fine mist or dew.
Now, this deposited mist or dew, being a liquid, and giving out all
the rays of heat possible to its temperature, would send its heat
into empty space much more rapidly than the saturated air; therefore
it would become colder than the air around it. Thus more air
would be cooled, and more mist or dew deposited; and so on
until a complete change of condition should be brought about. In
this imaginary case the tiniest possible flake of snow has pulled
the trigger, as it were, and made the gun go off,&mdash;has altered completely<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
the whole arrangement that might have gone on for some
time longer as it was, had it not been for the advent of the snowflake.
We thus see how in our atmosphere the presence of a condensable
liquid adds an element of violence, and also of abruptness,
amounting to incalculability, to the motions which take place.
This means that our knowledge of meteorological phenomena can
never be mathematically complete, like our knowledge of planetary
motions, inasmuch as there exists an element of instability, and
therefore of incalculability, in virtue of which a very considerable
change may result from a very small cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>In view of the inherent difficulties it is certainly creditable that
the predictions of the United States Weather Bureau should prove
true six times in seven, greatly inuring to the safety of mariners,
of passengers by lake and sea, and to the saving of crops under
threat of destruction by storms.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />
SIMPLIFICATION</h2>

<p class="chaptoc">Simplicity always desirable, except when it costs too much .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Taking
direct instead of roundabout paths. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Omissions may be gainful .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Classification and signaling simpler than ever before.</p>

<p class="chapstart">For a simple task the inventor&#8217;s means should be as simple as
possible. Mr. J. J. Thomas in his &#8220;Farm Implements&#8221;
says<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<h3>Simplicity of Build Desirable.</h3>

<p>&#8220;After a trial of a multitude of implements and machines, we
fall back on those of the most simple form, other things being
equal. The crow-bar has been employed from
time immemorial, and it will not likely go out
of use in our day. For simplicity nothing exceeds
it. Spades, hoes, forks are of similar
character. The plow, though made up of parts, becomes a single
thing when all are bolted and screwed together. For this reason,
with its moderate weight, it moves through the soil with little difficulty&mdash;turning
aside for obstructions, on account of its wedge
form, when it cannot remove them. The harrow, although composed
of many pieces, becomes a fixed, solid frame, moving on
through the soil as a single piece. So with simpler cultivators.
Contrast these with Pratt&#8217;s ditching machine considerably used
some years ago, but ending in failure. It was ingeniously constructed
and well made, and when new and every part uninjured,
worked admirably in some soils. But it was made up of many
parts and weighed nearly half a ton. These two facts fixed its
doom. A complex machine of this weight moving three to five
feet per second, could not strike a large stone without a formidable
jar, and continued repetitions of such blows bent and deranged
the working parts. After using a while, these bent portions retarded
its working; it must be frequently stopped, the horses becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
badly fatigued, and all the machines were finally thrown
aside. This is a single example of what must always occur with
the use of heavy complex machinery working in the soil. Mowing
and reaping machines may seem to be exceptions. But they do
not work in the soil, or among stones; but operate on the soft,
slightly resisting stems of plants. Every farmer knows what becomes
of them when they are repeatedly driven against obstructions
by careless teamsters.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Simplification Has Limits.</h3>

<p>In discussing form we saw that simple shapes, such as those of
sticks cut from a cylindrical tree, are not so strong as the less
simple forms of hollow cylinders. We found
that a joist, of plain rectangular section, is not
so good a burdenbearer as a girder whose section
resembles the letter I. If a slide for a
timber is to be built on a mountain side, a novice would suppose
that a straight inclined plane would afford the speediest path for
the descending wood. Not so. More speedy is a slide contoured
as a cycloid, the curve traced by a pencil fastened to the rim of a
wheel as the wheel rolls along a floor beside a wall against which
the pencil presses.</p>

<p>Not all tasks are simple, so that it is often best to build and use
a machine as complicated as a turret-lathe or a Jacquard loom.
Whatever the inventor seeks first, last and all the time is Economy;
to that end he adopts whatever means will serve him best,
whether simple or not. Professor A. B. W. Kennedy, famous as
a teacher of machine design, says<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Simplicity does not mean fewness of parts. Reuleaux showed
long ago that with machines there was in every case a practical
minimum number of parts, any reduction below which was accompanied
by serious practical drawbacks. Nor is real simplicity incompatible
with considerable apparent complexity. The purposes
of machines being continually more complex, simplicity must not
be looked upon as absolute, but only in its relation to a particular
purpose. There are many very complex-looking pieces of apparatus
which work so directly along each of their main branch
lines that they are in reality simple. It is usual that the first
attempt to carry out a new purpose results in a very complicated
machine. It is only by the closest examination of the problem, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
getting at its very essence, that the machine can be simplified.
If a problem is only soluble by extremely complicated apparatus,
it becomes a question whether it is worth having. Closely allied
to simplicity is Directness. Certain transformations are unavoidable,
but the fewer the better. In some cases they may be as indispensable
as the abused middleman in matters economic. In the
first machine to do something mechanically hitherto done by
hand, the error is often made of trying to imitate hand-work
rigorously. The first sewing-machine was, I believe, made to
stitch in the same way as a seamstress. It was not until a form
of stitch suitable for a machine, although unsuitable for the hand,
was devised, that the sewing-machine was successful. The first
railroad carriages were practically stage-coaches put on trucks,
from which the present carriages have only very slowly been
evolved.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Directness.</h3>

<p>A few years ago it was usual to attach pumps, dynamos, and
other machinery to their actuating engines by pulleys and belts.
To-day in most cases the connection is direct;
all the energy which would be absorbed by intervening
wheels and leather is saved. In steam-turbines
one and the same shaft carries the steam-vanes and the
armature of an electrical generator. In saw-mills of modern design
a very long steam cylinder is provided with a piston directly
attached to the saw carriage. The same principle gives high
economy to the steam hammer and pile-driver of Nasmyth. Hammers,
drills, cutters and other tools driven by compressed air are
directly attached to the rod which holds the piston. In like manner
Saunders&#8217; channeling machine, actuated by steam, has its cutters
attached to its piston, so that a blow is dealt with no intervening
crank-shaft, lever or spring.</p>

<p>Direct, too, is the binding machine for magazines and cheap
books, which simply stitches with wire the whole together at the
back, as if so many thicknesses of cloth. With the same immediacy
we have wall-papers printed directly from the oak or maple
they are to represent. Indeed, veneers are now so cheap and good
as to be used instead of paper as wall coverings. In the province
of art Mr. Hubert Herkomer has accomplished a notable feat in
the way of directness, dispensing with the camera, or any of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
etcher&#8217;s preliminaries of biting or rocking. He paints in monochrome
on a copper plate as he would on a panel or canvas, covers
his painting with fine bronze powder to harden the surface, from
which he then takes an electrotype.</p>

<p>A supreme feat of directness was the invention of a machine
which relates itself to art, science and business, the phonograph.
Forty years ago Faber constructed a talking machine of bellows
to imitate the lungs, with an artificial throat, larynx, and lips
affording a weird and faulty imitation of the voice. Edison, bidding
sound-waves impress themselves directly on a plastic cylinder,
reproduces human tones and other sounds with vastly better
effect. Faber sought to copy the method of voice production.
Edison set himself the task of taking tones as produced and
making them impress a surface from which they can be repeated
at will.</p>

<h3>Contrivances Which Pay a Double Debt.</h3>

<p>A lamp commonly used by camping parties, and well worthy
of wider employment, is at once a source of heat and light; while
it boils a kettle it sheds an ample beam upon
one&#8217;s table or book. Just this union of two
services may be found in the crude lamp of
the Eskimo.</p>

<p>Many processes of manufacture once separate are now united
with economy of time and power. Steam cylinders for mangling,
ironing and surfacing paper, effect smoothing and drying at one
operation. Green lumber for making furniture is bent and seasoned
at the same time. Wire is tempered as drawn. At first
reflectors were distinct from lamps; in an excellent form of <a href="#Fig85">incandescent
bulb</a> the upper part of the container is silvered, increasing
the efficiency of reflection in decided measure, as shown
on page 75.</p>

<h3>Ascertaining Solid Contents.</h3>

<p>Sometimes an indirect path is better than a direct course; or,
as the sailors say: &#8220;The longest way round is the shortest way
there.&#8221; We can readily measure the contents
of solids which are regular or fairly regular of
outline. It is easy to compute or estimate the
contents of a stone as hewn by a mason to form part of a wall, but
to find the volume of a rough boulder by direct measurement is too
difficult a task to be worth while. Let us have recourse, then, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
an indirect plan which goes back to Archimedes: it will remind us
of how the casting process evades the toil of chipping or hammering
a mass of metal into a desired form. We take a vessel
of regular shape, preferably a cylinder, duly graduated, and
partly fill it with water. Any solid, however irregular, immersed
therein, will at once have its contents declared by the height to
which the water rises in its container, the water-levels before and
after the immersion being compared. Incidentally we here have
a means of ascertaining specific gravities. Weigh this body before
and during immersion; comparison of the two quantities will
tell the specific gravity of the body, that is its density as compared
with that of water. For example a mass of iron which in air
weighs 7.75 pounds will in water weigh 6.75 pounds, so that the
specific gravity of iron is 7.75, the difference between the two
weights being unity.</p>

<p>Sometimes we wish to know the solid contents of a body which
will not bear immersion in water; a mass of gum, for instance.
In such a case we immerse the body in a graduated vessel filled
with fine dry sand, carefully sifted free of hollow spaces. Both
before and after immersion the sand is brought to a level which
is carefully noted. The difference between these levels, measured
in the graduations of the container, gives the solid contents of
the immersed body.</p>

<h3>Measuring Refraction.</h3>

<p>The degree in which a crystal, or a particular kind of glass,
bends a beam of light is usually measured by giving the crystal or
glass the form of a prism, through which rays
are sent. Sometimes a crystal is so small and
irregular that this method is not feasible. Then
the inquirer resorts to an indirect plan. He immerses the crystal
in liquids which he mixes until the crystal disappears through
ceasing to bend light differently from the surrounding bath. He
then fills a hollow glass prism with this liquid, and in noting its
refraction he learns that of the immersed crystal.</p>

<h3>Omission of Needless Elements.</h3>

<p>A fresh eye, with a keen brain behind it, often detects wasted
work in a process long sanctioned by tradition. At the Tamarac
Copper Mine, in Northern Michigan, some new ore-crushers were
needed in 1891. Among the engineers who sought to furnish
these machines was Mr. Edwin Reynolds, of Milwaukee, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
improvements of the Corliss engine have made him famous. That
he might see ore-crushers at work for the first time in his life, he
visited the Tamarac mine. He observed that
the stamps were built on an immense bed of
costly timbers and rubber sheets, supposed to
be indispensable to efficiency. His eye, unwarped
by harmful familiarity, utterly condemned this elastic foundation.
He at once proposed to discard both timbers and rubber, and rear
new crushers directly on a vast block of solid iron. This heresy
quite shocked the directors of the Tamarac Company; they stood
out against Mr. Reynolds&#8217; plan for two years. Then, with profound
misgivings, they allowed him to erect a stamp of the
cheap and simple pattern he had suggested, so laying the iron bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
that, in case of its expected failure, work would be delayed not
more than two days. Up went the Reynolds&#8217; stamp, and out
poured sixty per cent. more crushed ore than from a preceding
machine using the same power. Instant by instant its energy was
wholly exerted in crushing rock, not largely in the useless compression
of an enormous elastic bed.</p>

<p>Long before there was any Tamarac Mine, inventors had bothered
themselves providing for difficulties as imaginary as those
which, at vast outlay, were met by the timber underpinning of
old-time ore stamps. In 1825 the builders of locomotives at
Easton, in England, provided their engine-wheels with teeth which
worked into racks with corresponding projections. They were
afraid that a smooth wheel on a smooth track would slip without
onward motion. Their unnecessary gear was discarded when it
was found that under a heavy engine a smooth wheel has adequate
adhesion on a rail as smooth as itself. Toothed wheels and racks
are now only at work on the railroads of Mount Washington and
other steep acclivities. As James Watt used to say to William
Murdock, his trusted lieutenant,&mdash;&#8220;It is a great thing to know
what to do without. We must have a book of <i>blots</i>&mdash;things to
be scratched out.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Printers Abandon Useless Work.</h3>

<p>Daily newspapers in part owe their cheapness to an omission
that at first seemed bold enough. For many years printing paper,
made in continuous rolls each of a mile or
more, used to be cut into sheets, fed one by one
to the press. It was a long stride in economy
when the printer left the roll alone, and let an
automatic press feed itself from the unwinding paper, cutting off
a sheet only after the printing.</p>

<h3>Electricity Used as Produced.</h3>

<p>A parallel example is recorded in the twin art of telegraphy.
At first it was believed that two wires were indispensable for a
circuit. Steinheil showed that a single wire
suffices if its terminals are soldered into plates
buried in the ground. Thus, at a stroke, by
impressing the earth into the service of electrical
communication, he reduced the cost of telegraphic lines by
one half. In another field the electrician has given himself a
good deal of trouble in vain. As it originally streamed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
voltaic batteries, the electric current had always a single direction;
it was, to use a familiar phrase, a direct current. But when Faraday
invented the first dynamo, and produced electricity from
mechanical motion instead of from more costly chemical energy,
the current was not direct but alternating; that is, its pulses came
at one instant from the positive pole, the next instant from the
negative. Inventors took great pains in devising apparatus to
convert these alternating pulses into a direct current such as that
yielded by a voltaic battery. To-day the alternating current for
many important purposes, including transportation, is employed
just as it leaves the dynamo. Such a current usually has comparatively
high tension, at which transmission is much more
economical than at low tension, small conductors serving instead
of large ones. This advantage in many cases more than offsets
the loss entailed by reversal of the magnetic field at each alternation;
a loss but small when iron for the electro-magnets is well
chosen.</p>

<h3>Short Cuts in Engineering.</h3>

<p>Rock may be so hard as to withstand a drill of the hardest
steel; then the engineer pours an acid of the necessary dissolving
power. A water pipe may freeze at a point
difficult of access; it is thawed by the warmth
created by an electric current. A surveyor has
to reduce to square feet the irregular area of a
factory site or a garden plot; around the edge of his diagram he
runs a planimeter, it tells him automatically what surface it has
surrounded in its excursion. If he has no planimeter, a delicate
balance will serve just as well. Let him take a piece of paper,
uniform in thickness, and cut it into the shape of the area in
question. In weighing the diagram with care he learns its superficies
because he knows the weight of each square inch or foot of
the paper. Pumps for ages have exercised the wit of inventors
who have devised wheels, screws, pistons, and scoops of every
imaginable form. M. Giffard boldly discarded all moving parts
whatever and in his injector, actuated directly by a blast of steam,
provided a capital means of sending water into a boiler.</p>

<p>A generation ago engineers of eminence were attempting the
transmission of energy in a variety of ways. Ropes and wire
cables were installed for considerable distances in Germany and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
Switzerland; in France there was an extensive piping of compressed
air, still in evidence at the capital; and water under high
pressure is to some extent to-day employed in London. All these
schemes, together with the old methods within a shop itself of
taking motion from motor to machine by belt or chain, have been
wiped off the slate by the electrical engineer. With a tax of the
lightest he carries for many miles in a slender wire a current
whose energy takes any form we please,&mdash;not only mechanical
motion, but chemical action, light or heat. Can simplification go
farther than this, or the future hold for us another gift as golden?</p>

<h3>Painting by Immersion.</h3>

<p>Binders, reapers, and mowers have irregular surfaces which it
would be costly to paint by hand. Even to use the painting machine
which works by compressed air would
be somewhat expensive. In the painting shop
of a factory both brushes and nozzles are banished.
The large floor is fitted up with a series
of tanks: overhead are the lines of a suspension railway. The
tanks are filled with paint, the articles to be treated are run in on
the rails, lowered automatically for their bath, and then carried
off to drip and to dry. In this way a large and complicated agricultural
machine can be painted in a few seconds. Were deep
tanks employed, this method would squeeze oil, varnish, or paint
into the pores of wood very thoroughly.</p>

<h3>Churning the Air in a Telescopic Tube.</h3>

<p>Astronomers suffer much from the inaccuracy of the images
viewed in their telescopes in consequence of the disturbances in
the atmosphere, common even in clear weather.
Hence observatories have, of late years, been
established at Arequipa, Peru, and at other stations
where the atmosphere is calm and little
disturbed by currents. On investigation Professor S. P. Langley,
of Washington, discovered that a good deal of the perturbation
of telescopic images arises from currents within the telescopic
tube itself. As a remedy he adopted the heroic, yet simple,
measure of thoroughly stirring up the air in the tube by a blower
or other suitable means. Its air, thus brought to uniformity of
condition, yielded images much clearer than those usually obtained.
Especially convincing in this regard are capital photographs
of artificial double stars whose beams were entirely confined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
within a horizontal tube in which they traveled to and fro
through no less than 140 feet of churned air. These pictures
showed that the disturbance within the tube itself appeared to be
wholly eliminated by the device of vigorously stirring the air
column.</p>

<p>This recalls a method of shipping pianos in refrigerator cars.
The instruments are carefully brought to the temperature of the
car, which is maintained at about zero, Centigrade. When the
pianos arrive at their destination they are slowly warmed to the
temperature of common air. No matter how long they have been
cold, they suffer no hurt; for it is not cold, or moderate elevation
of temperature, that does harm so much as uneasy fluctuations
from one to the other.</p>

<h3>Loose Cards Replace Books.</h3>

<p>When one visits a public library, the title of a particular book
is found in the catalogue in a moment. Every book as acquired
has its title written on a card, and thousands of
such cards are placed in alphabetical order, just
like the words in a dictionary. A thousand
cards or so begin with &#8220;A,&#8221; and are placed in a drawer marked
&#8220;A,&#8221; which stands first in the case, and so with the rest. There
is always room to spare in each drawer, so that when a card for
a new book comes in there is space for it. It was a happy thought
of a Dutch inventor when he thus made an index which can always
be alphabetical, easily added to or subtracted from, simply
because its leaves are mere cards with the binding of a common
index omitted. In public libraries the catalogue-cards are of
standard sizes, so also are the drawers in which these are disposed.
In fact library-furniture of all kinds is to-day thoroughly
standardized in its styles and dimensions, making it easy to fit
up or to extend a library whether public or private.</p>

<p>The use of cards, or slips for like purposes, has passed from
the library to the business office, the study, the housekeeper&#8217;s
desk. Merchants keep their customers&#8217; names on this plan, so as
to send them price lists from time to time. Depositors in banks,
policy-holders in assurance companies, tenants of real estate in
cities, members of clubs, are all recorded in this simple and
accessible fashion. Some great manufacturing houses receive
a million letters in a twelvemonth; an adaptation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
card-index makes any single letter accessible in half a minute at
most. To an extent which steadily grows, the same plan is ousting
the old-fashioned ledgers from our offices; in their stead we are
now using series of movable leaves which are removed when
filled, giving place to new leaves in an unbroken round.</p>

<div class="figc400" id="Fig221">
<img src="images/illo402.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="269" />
<p class="caption">Notes on loose cards in alphabetical order.</p>
</div>

<p>A good many readers make notes as they go. If these are
written in books they soon become so numerous, so various of
topic, as to demand laborious indexing. It is better to take the
notes in a form which will index itself. Slips of good paper can
be bought at low cost, and, as in the accompanying <a href="#Fig221">illustration</a>,
&#8220;Astronomy,&#8221; &#8220;Glass,&#8221; &#8220;Photography,&#8221; or other headings may be
adopted. All the slips under a given head are numbered consecutively.
Kept on edge in a shallow box, or tray, they are self-indexing,
and a new slip takes its proper place at once. From its
compactness this kind of note-keeping puts a premium on the
abbreviations which suggest themselves in a special study.</p>

<h3>Unit Systems.</h3>

<p>A card system employed as a catalogue, or for account keeping,
is made up of simple units which may be added to or deducted
from with utmost ease. They may be manipulated
as readily as the bricks, all alike, with
which a child builds a house, a box, or a steeple.
This principle a few years ago was extended to book-cases, each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
about a foot high and about thirty-three inches long; while each
formed a unit by itself it could be combined with other such units
to furnish forth a library.
This plan had been adopted
for office furniture of all
kinds,&mdash;cabinets in which
papers may be filed away, or
which are divided into
pigeon-holes for blanks and
the like. In some handsome
designs a unit unfolds as a
small writing desk, while
adjacent units contain drawers
of various sizes. Each
unit is so moderate in dimensions
as to be readily
portable; a dozen, a score, a
hundred may be joined together
to equip a sitting-room
or the cashier&#8217;s office
in a bank.</p>

<h3>Numbering as a Fine Art.</h3>

<p>When an American visits
London for the first time, he
may fall into an error which
will much provoke him. Suppose
that he has to call at 457 Strand. He begins at number 1
in that thoroughfare, and proceeds a goodly distance when, to his
dismay he observes that the numbers he is
passing on his right are strictly consecutive,&mdash;100,
101, 102 and so on. A weary trudge
brings him to 457, opposite number 1, whence he started. That
odd numbers should be on one side of the street, and even numbers
on the other, did not occur to the city fathers of London
centuries ago. In this regard a forward step was taken in Philadelphia,
where the streets parallel with the Delaware River are
First, Second, and so on, while each house on the streets crossing
them from the river westward is so numbered as to tell between
what streets it stands. Thus, when we walk up Chestnut Street,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
the first door above Ninth Street, on the right, is 901, although
the house next below it, across Ninth Street, is 839; and so on
with all parallel streets. If the thoroughfares in Philadelphia,
running at right angles to the Delaware River, were labeled avenues,
and consecutively numbered, the system would be a troublesaver
indeed.</p>

<p>In New York the cross streets as they run east or west of
Fifth Avenue are named east or west. In crossing each avenue
eastward or westward the numbers jump to the next whole
hundred, as in Philadelphia. The building at the southwestern
corner of Third Avenue and East 23rd Street is 162; that on the
eastward corner, opposite, is 200. Thus in cross streets the number
of a house tells us between which avenues it will be found.</p>

<p>In hotels and office-buildings, throughout America, the numbering
greatly aids an inquirer. Room 512, for example, will be
found on the fifth floor; immediately beneath is 412 on the fourth
floor; directly above is 612 on the sixth floor, the first figure always
denoting the floor.</p>

<h3>Classifying Books.</h3>

<p>A capital use of numerals to convey information is that devised
by Melvil Dewey, formerly State Librarian of New York at
Albany. He divides literature into ten great
departments, giving each of them one of the
ten numerals. History, in this scheme, is represented
by 9 as the first figure in the number of a book; the second
figure refers to the geographical division to which the work
belongs, thus 7 means North America; the third figure standing
for the political division treated by the book, 1 representing the
British Empire. A work on Canadian history, therefore, will bear
as its number, 971.</p>

<h3>An Advance in Scientific Signaling.</h3>

<p>Everybody knows what a money-saver is the familiar code of the
ocean cables, by which &#8220;befogged&#8221; stands for &#8220;Will the property
be advertised for sale?&#8221; reducing the toll by
the cost of six words. Most of the terms in a
code are not dictionary words, but such collocations
of letters as &#8220;carthurien&#8221; and &#8220;brankstrop.&#8221;
A new code devised by Mr. Charles G. Burke, of New
York, proceeds upon the use of four numerals, 1, 2, 3, 4, which
he transmits in the fewest signals possible to a cable, 1 is a dot; 2<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
a dash, 3 a dash-dot; 4 a dot-dash. This is how they look when
received on paper in comparison with ordinary messages<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>It is the separate signal with the time consumed in its transmission
which is the real unit of cost. The codes now in use employ
words whose letters, as signaled, demand more than twice
the time required by the Burke system. Thus 4221332, as transmitted
by Mr. Burke, means &#8220;Advise creditor to prove claim and
accept dividend,&#8221; for which but ten signals suffice. In the codes
now in the hands of the public, an average word of seven letters
would contain twenty-three signals. How wide is the variety of
sentences possible in the new method? If the numerals are employed
in permutations of seven figures, as 1342423, a Burke code
will contain 16384 sentences; in permutations of eight figures,
four-fold, and in permutations of nine figures, sixteen-fold as
many, or 262,144 sentences, a variety much more ample than that
of any other system. Mr. Burke finds that an average code message
has 8 letters to a word, each word requiring about 25 electrical
impulses in transmission; an average permutation on his
system does not demand more than 10 impulses.</p>

<p>Mr. Burke has also devised a capital mode of simplifying telegraphic
signals of all kinds. A message in the usual Morse code
has dots, dashes and spaces, each produced by depressing a key
for a short, a long, or a longer period. Mr. Burke interrupts a
current with a key solely with dot-intervals; the periods during
which the current is unbroken are, according to their length, dot-signals,
dash-signals, or spaces<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

and experiment .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Professor Tyndall&#8217;s views .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Discursiveness illustrated

<h3>Theories as Finder Thoughts.</h3>

<p class="chapstart">As far back as the first man with brains in his head, there was
an ache to know why the sun shone, the stars twinkled, the
winds blew, why harvests here were plentiful and there scant.
The whole burden of witchcraft, of fetichism, of beliefs in voodoo,
is a pathetic proof of this human longing
to explain. What, after all, are superstitions
but premature explanations that overstay their
time? When men of thought get a glimpse of
an interpretation really true, they are eager to prolong that
glimpse until it becomes a survey whose due tests confirm and
buttress a well grounded anticipation. This exploring process
reminds us of what took place long ago when an architect of unexampled
boldness first imagined a dome for a temple, and
brought his dream to fulfilment. He began by rearing a single
arch, fairly strong, yet hardly strong enough; a second arch arose
to meet the first at their common crest; now, in mutual support
both had a stability neither could display alone; at last when the
wall had gone full circle it had a strength vastly greater than
that of any part by itself. The long-admired arch had indeed
become no more than an element to be joined with other arches to
create a unit of an order distinctly higher.</p>

<p>For ages the men who studied nature looked upon it as little
changed since it left its Maker&#8217;s hand. Of infinite stimulus was
the perception that it is a drama, not a tableau, which spreads itself
before the eye. Speedily and with incomparable instruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
it was traced how every actor in that drama had been molded
by the part it had played in maintaining itself upon the stage of
life. Every rival, parasite or foe, every stress of climate, was
studied in its influence on food or frame, while the ever-threatened
doom for irresponsiveness was the extinction which befell
countless forms once masters of the earth. No hue of scale or
feather, no barb or tusk, no curve of beak or note of song but
served a purpose in the plot or advanced the action in some conflict
to the death. When Darwin was confronted in plant or beast
by an organ or a habit which puzzled him, he was wont to ask,
What use can this have had? And seldom was the question asked
in vain. He laid great stress on the directive worth of a well-considered
theory. He tells us, &#8220;I am a firm believer that without
speculation there is no good and original observation.&#8221; In a letter
he remarks, &#8220;It is an old and firm conviction of mine that the
naturalists who accumulate facts and make many partial generalizations
are the <i>real</i> benefactors of science. Those who merely
accumulate facts I cannot very much respect.&#8221;</p>

<p>In rising from facts to explanations a weighty debt is due to
modern aids to eyes and hands. To men who knew only what
direct vision could tell them in a single life-time, it was but natural
to repeat<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;The thing that hath been, is that which shall be;
and that which is done, is that which shall be done; and there is
no new thing under the sun.&#8221; But we of to-day are in different
case. The astronomer, joining camera to telescope, lengthens the
diameter of the known universe a thousand-fold; he discovers
system after system in stages of life such as our sun and its attendant
orbs have passed through in ages so remote as to refuse
computation. And many types of nebulae and stars are now
studied which were never so much as imagined until they revealed
themselves upon the photographic plate. Meanwhile the
geologist, examining the closely welded ribs of our globe, comparing
the birds, beasts and men of to-day with their earliest
known ancestry, believes that the earth has been a scene of life for
a million centuries or more. As we restore one act after another
in this great cosmical drama, we are able to forecast those which
may next appear. Because the whole scheme of things from
centre to rim pulses in one ethereal ocean, every actor has interplay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
with every other, so that the sweep of events discloses a unity
all the more intimate the more closely it is studied. At this hour
physicists and chemists, with electricity their new servant at command,
are gathering proof that what have long been called &#8220;elements,&#8221;
are probably one substance, variously assembled, moving
at speeds and in paths infinitely diverse, repeating in little the
mighty swings of suns and planets. Throughout these researches
a constant spur is the thought that here may be traced such processes
of development as have been laid bare in every other province
of nature. From circumference to centre, evolution is the
master key of each keen questioner.</p>

<h3>Modern Views of Matter.</h3>

<p>Organic nature to the modern interpreter is thus alive through
and through. In his view atom and molecule are also alive in a
subordinate, elemental degree. Indeed, he
thinks, it is their life borne in air, water and
food which in plant or animal rises to new
planes of dignity. He looks afresh at the broken alum crystal
which repairs itself in a solution, and sees there the removal of the
imaginary fence which long divided organic nature from inorganic.
(See <a href="#Fig171">illustration</a>, page 194.) It was a shrewd guess of
Sir Isaac Newton that the diamond is combustible; he did not
suspect it to be carbon, but he knew it to be highly refrangible as
are many combustible bodies. His conjecture shows him taking
the first step toward the current view that properties, the modes
of behavior of matter, are not passive qualities, but are due to
real activities; that what a substance is depends upon how its
ultimate parts move. Clausius and Maxwell in a theory which
marks a new era explained the elasticity of gases as manifested in
the ceaseless motion of their molecules, declaring that an ounce of
air within a fragile jar is able to sustain the pressure of the atmosphere
around it, because the air, though only an ounce in weight,
dashes against its container with an impact forcible enough to
balance the external pressure. Proof whereof appears in measuring
the velocity of air as it rushes into a vacuum. Here a
significant point is that in leaving the realm of mass-mechanics,
where the tax of friction is inexorable, we enter a sphere where
the swiftest motion may go on forever without paying friction
the smallest levy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<h3>Elasticity Explained.</h3>

<p>Elasticity of solids is explained on the same principle. If we
swiftly turn a gyroscopic wheel we can only change its plane of
rotation by an effort, which effort is repaid
when the metal is allowed to resume its original
plane of motion. It is imagined that in like
manner the particles in an elastic spring move rapidly in a definite
plane; if deflected therefrom they oppose resistance and are ready
to do work in returning thereto. Of kindred to the kinetic theory
of elasticity is the explanation of heat as a distinct and ceaseless
molecular motion on which the dimensions of masses depend. It
has long seemed to me that every case of &#8220;potential&#8221; energy, as
that of a spring bent or coiled, may in like manner embody actual
though impalpable and invisible motion. I presented this view in
the Popular Science Monthly, December, 1876.</p>

<p>The very constitution of matter is now referred to the motions,
highly diversified, of the simplest substance possible. Helmholtz,
Lord Kelvin, and Professor Clerk Maxwell have imagined
the molecules of lead, iron, or other element as vortices born of
the ether in which without resistance they forever whirl. As we
see in the case of a quickly rotated chain, substantial rigidity is
conferred by motion sufficiently swift. Nor are molecules without
somewhat of individuality. We are wont to think of masses
of solid iron as precisely similar in quality, but experience shows
us that one bar of iron may vary from another by all that has
differenced the history of the two. A careful workman uses
a steel die for only a short service before he returns it to the annealer,
well assured that the metal, despite its seeming wholeness,
has suffered severe internal strain at every blow, which, were no
caution exercised, would soon reveal itself in fracture of the die,
or ruined work. Facts of this kind, which every day confront
the mechanic and engineer, convey a prophecy of the sensibility
and memory which dawn with life.</p>

<h3>Guesses and Proof.</h3>

<p>A theory helpful to the observer or the experimenter comes at
last, in many cases, from much guessing. The theorist fills his
mind with facts, broods over them, endeavors
to explain them, but whether his theory is true
or false must be decided solely by proof. This
point was clearly stated by Dr. Pye-Smith, of London, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
Harveian oration, 1893<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;As Paley justly puts it, he only discovers
who proves. To hit upon a true conjecture here and there,
amid a crowd of untrue, and leave it again without appreciation
of its importance, is a sign, not of intelligence, but of frivolity.
We are told that of the seven wise men of Greece, one (I believe
it was Thales) taught that the sun did not go around the earth,
but the earth around the sun. Hence it has been said that
Thales anticipated Copernicus&mdash;a flagrant example of the fallacy
in question. A crowd of idle philosophers who sat through the
long summer days and nights of Attica discussing all things in
heaven and earth must sometimes have hit upon a true opinion,
if only by accident, but Thales, or whoever broached the heliocentric
dogma, had no reason for his belief and showed himself
not more, but less, reasonable than his companions. The crude
theories and gross absurdities of phrenology are not in the least
justified or even excused by the present knowledge of cerebral
localization; nor do the baseless speculations of Lamarck and
Erasmus Darwin entitle them to be regarded as the forerunners
of Charles Darwin. Up to 1859 impartial and competent men
were bound to disbelieve in evolution. After that date, or at
least, so soon as the facts and arguments of Darwin and Wallace
had been published, they were equally bound to believe in it. He
discovers who proves, and by this test Harvey is the sole and
absolute discoverer of the movements of the heart and of the
blood.&#8221;</p>

<h3>The Knitting Faculty.</h3>

<p>Discovery is the reward of diligence, such as that of Harvey,
but not of diligence alone. Professor William James, in his
Psychology remarks<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;The inquirer starts
with a fact of which he sees the reason, or a
theory of which he sees the proof. In either
case he keeps turning the matter incessantly in his mind, until
by the arousal of associate upon associate, some habitual, some
similar, one arises which he recognizes to suit his need. This,
however, may take years. No rules can be given by which the
investigator can proceed straight to his result; but both here and
in the case of reminiscence the accumulation of helps in the way
of associations may advance more rapidly by the use of certain
methods. In striving to recall a thought, for example, we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
of set purpose run through the successive classes of circumstances
with which it may possibly have been connected, trusting
that when the right member of the class has turned up it will
help the thought&#8217;s revival. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In scientific research this accumulation
of associates has been methodized by Mill as &#8216;four
methods of experimental inquiry.&#8217; By the method of Agreement,
of Difference, of Residues, and of Concomitant Variations,
we make certain lists of cases, and by ruminating these lists in
our minds the cause we seek will be more likely to emerge. But
the final stroke of discovery is only prepared, not effected by
them. The brain tracts must, of their own accord, shoot the
right way at last, or we shall still grope in darkness.&#8221;</p>

<h3>The Detection of Likeness Beneath Diversity.</h3>

<p>Among the talents of the discoverer, perhaps the chief is to
detect similarity in phenomena which, to casual observation, are
unlike. Of this the capital example is Franklin&#8217;s
proof that lightning and common frictional
electricity are one and the same. Professor
Alexander Bain, in &#8220;The Senses and
the Intellect,&#8221; thus describes this talent<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;When
it first occurred to a reflecting mind that moving water
had a property identical with human or brute force, namely, the
property of setting other masses in motion, overcoming resistance
and inertia&mdash;when the sight of the stream suggested
through this point of likeness the power of the animal&mdash;a new
addition was made to the class of prime movers, and when circumstances
permitted, this power could be made a substitute for
the others. It may seem to the modern understanding, familiar
with water-wheels and drifting rafts, that the similarity here
was an extremely obvious one. But if we put ourselves back
into an early state of mind, when running water affected the
mind by its brilliancy, its roar, and irregular devastation, we may
easily suppose that to identify this with animal muscular energy
was by no means an obvious effect. Doubtless when a mind arose,
insensible by natural constitution to the superficial aspects of
things, and having withal a great stretch of identifying intellect,
such a comparison would then be possible. We may pursue the
same example one stage further, and come to the discovery of
steam-power, or the identification of expanding vapor with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
previously known sources of mechanical force. To the common
eye, for ages, vapor presented itself as clouds in the sky; or, as
a hissing noise at the spout of a kettle, with the formation of a
foggy, curling cloud at a few inches&#8217; distance. The forcing up
of the lid of a kettle may also have been occasionally observed.
But how long was it ere any one was struck with parallelism
of this appearance with a blast of wind, a rush of water, or an
exertion of animal muscle? The discordance was too great to
be broken through by such a faint and limited amount of likeness.
In one mind, however, the identification did take place,
and was followed out into its consequences. The likeness had
occurred to other minds previously, but not with the same results.
Such minds must have been in some way or other distinguished
above the millions of mankind, and we are endeavoring
to give an explanation of their superiority. The intellectual
character of Watt contained all the elements preparatory to a
great stroke of similarity in such a case&mdash;a high susceptibility,
both by nature and education, to the mechanical properties of
bodies; ample previous knowledge, or familiarity; and indifference
to the superficial and sensational effects of things. It is
not only possible, however, but exceedingly probable, that many
men possessed all these accomplishments; they are of a kind not
transcending common abilities. They would in some degree attach
to a mechanical education, as a matter of course. That the
discovery was not sooner made supposes that something farther,
and not of common occurrence was necessary; and this additional
endowment appears to be the identifying power of similarity in
general; the tendency to detect likeness in the midst of disparity
and disguise. This supposition accounts for the fact, and is consistent
with the known intellectual character of the inventor of
the steam engine.&#8221;</p>

<h3>The Part Played by Imagination.</h3>

<p>A discoverer needs for success much more than identifying
power. Professor John Tyndall, one of the chief expositors of
science in the nineteenth century, speaks thus
of the part played by an investigator&#8217;s imagination<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;How are the hidden things of nature to be
revealed? How, for example, are we to lay hold of the physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
basis of light, since, like that of life itself, it lies entirely outside
the domain of the senses? Now philosophers may be right in
affirming that we cannot transcend experience. But we can, at all
events, carry it a long way from its origin. We can also magnify,
diminish, qualify, and combine experiences, so as to render them
fit for purposes entirely new. We are gifted with the power of
Imagination, and by this power we can lighten the darkness
which surrounds the world of the senses. There are tories even in
science who regard imagination as a faculty to be feared and
avoided rather than employed. They had observed its action in
weak vessels and were unduly impressed by its disasters. But
they might with equal justice point to exploded boilers as an
argument against the use of steam. Bounded and conditioned by
co-operative reason, imagination becomes the mightiest instrument
of the physical discoverer. Newton&#8217;s passage from a falling apple
to a falling moon was, at the outset, a leap of the imagination.
When William Thomson tries to place the ultimate particles of
matter between his compass points, and to apply to them a scale of
millimeters, he is powerfully aided by this faculty. And in much
that has recently been said about protoplasm and life, we have
the outgoings of the imagination guided and controlled by the
known analogies of science. In fact, without this power, our
knowledge of nature would be a mere tabulation of co-existences
and sequences. We should still believe in the succession of day
and night, of summer and winter; but the soul of Force would be
dislodged from our universe; causal relations would disappear,
and with them that science which is now binding the parts of nature
into an organic whole.&#8221;</p>

<p>Professor Tyndall also tells us how sound theories are divided
from unsound<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<h3>Theories Must be Verified.</h3>

<p>&#8220;From a starting-point furnished from his own researches or
those of others, the investigator proceeds by combining intuition
and verification. He ponders the knowledge he
possesses and tries to push it further, he guesses
and checks his guess, he conjectures and confirms
or explodes his conjecture. These
guesses and conjectures are by no means leaps in the dark; for
knowledge once gained casts a faint light beyond its own immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
boundaries. There is no discovery so limited as not to
illuminate something beyond itself. The force of intellectual
penetration into this penumbral region which surrounds actual
knowledge is not, as some seem to think, dependent upon method,
but upon the genius of the investigator. There is, however, no
genius so gifted as not to need control and verification. The profoundest
minds know best that Nature&#8217;s ways are not at all times
their ways, and that the brightest flashes in the world of thought
are incomplete until they have been proved to have their counterparts
in the world of fact. Thus the vocation of the true experimentalist
may be defined as the continued exercise of spiritual insight,
and its incessant correction and realization. His experiments
constitute a body, of which his purified intuitions are, as it
were, the soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>Theories, however helpful, should be held with a loose hand.
He declares<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;In our conceptions and reasonings regarding the forces of
nature, we perpetually make use of symbols which, whenever
they possess a high representative value we dignify with the name
of theories. Thus, prompted by certain analogies, we ascribe electrical
phenomena to the action of a peculiar fluid, sometimes flowing,
sometimes at rest. Such conceptions have their advantages
and their disadvantages; they afford peaceful lodging to the intellect
for a time, but they also circumscribe it, and by-and-by,
when the mind has grown too large for its lodging, it often finds
difficulty in breaking down the walls of what has become its
prison instead of its home.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the same vein was the remark of Michael Faraday<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;I cannot
but doubt that he who as a mere philosopher has most power
of penetrating the secrets of nature, and guessing by hypothesis
at her mode of working, will also be most careful for his own safe
progress and that of others, to distinguish the knowledge which
consists of assumption, by which I mean theory and hypothesis,
from that which is the knowledge of facts and laws.&#8221;</p>

<p>He once wrote a letter on ray-vibrations to Mr. Richard Phillips;
at its close he said<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;I think it likely that I have made many
mistakes in the preceding pages, for even to myself my ideas on
this point appear only as the shadow of a speculation, or as one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
those impressions on the mind which are allowable for a time as
guides to thought and research. He who labors in experimental
inquiries, knows how numerous these are, and how often their
apparent fitness and beauty vanish before the progress and development
of real natural truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Summing up, then,&#8221; says Professor William Stanley Jevons,
in &#8220;Principles of Science,&#8221; &#8220;it would seem as if the mind of the
great discoverer must combine almost contradictory attributes. He
must be fertile in theories and hypotheses, and yet full of facts
and precise results of experience. He must entertain the feeblest
analogies, and the merest guesses at truth, and yet he must hold
them worthless until they are verified in experiment. When there
are any grounds of probability he must hold tenaciously to an old
opinion, and yet he must be prepared at any moment to relinquish
it when a single clear contradictory fact is encountered. &#8216;The
philosopher,&#8217; says Faraday, &#8216;should be a man willing to listen to
every suggestion, but determined to judge for himself. He should
not be biassed by appearances; have no favorite hypotheses; be
of no school; and in doctrine have no master. He should not be
a respecter of persons, but of things. Truth should be his primary
object. If to these qualities be added industry, he may indeed
hope to walk within the veil of the temple of nature.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Character, no less than mind of the highest order, ever distinguishes
the great researcher. Says Professor Tyndall<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;Those
who are unacquainted with the details of scientific investigation,
have no idea of the amount of labor expended on the determination
of those numbers on which important calculations or inferences
depend. They have no idea of the patience shown by a
Berzelius in determining atomic weights; by a Regnault in determining
co-efficients of expansion; or of a Joule in determining
the mechanical equivalent of heat. There is a morality brought to
bear upon such matters, which, in point of severity, is probably
without a parallel in any other domain of intellectual action.&#8221;</p>

<p>Surely there was a union of the highest character and of consummate
ability in Stas, the Belgian chemist, who eliminated from
his chemicals every trace of that pervasive element, sodium, so
thoroughly, that even its spectroscopic detection was impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<h3>A Word for Discursiveness.</h3>

<p>The greatest man of science that England has given to the
world was Sir Isaac Newton, second only to him was Dr. Thomas
Young, who established the wave-theory of
light, who deciphered Egyptian hieroglyphics
with marvelous skill, and was withal an accomplished
physician. In 1801 he was appointed
to the professorship of natural philosophy in the Royal Institution,
London, founded in 1800 by Benjamin Thompson, Count
Rumford, a native of Woburn, Massachusetts. When Dr. Young
died, Davies Gilbert, president of the Royal Society, delivered a
commemorative address in the course of which he declared that
in Young&#8217;s opinion it is probably most advantageous to mankind
that the researches of some inquirers should be concentrated within
a given compass, but that others should pass more rapidly
through a wider range. He believed that the faculties of the mind
were more exercised, and probably rendered stronger, by going
beyond the rudiments, and overcoming the great elementary difficulties,
of a variety of studies, than by employing the same number
of hours in any one pursuit&mdash;that the doctrine of the division of
labor, however applicable to material product, was not so to intellect;
and that it went to reduce the dignity of man in the scale
of rational existences. He thought it impossible to foresee the
capabilities of improvement in any science, so much of accident
having led to the most important discoveries, that no man could
say what might be the comparative advantage of any one study
rather than of another; though he would have scarcely recommended
the plan of his own course as a model to others, he still
was satisfied in the method which he had pursued.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />
THEORIZING&mdash;<i>Continued</i></h2>

<p class="chaptoc">Analogies have value .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Many principles may be reversed with profit .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The contrary of an old method may be gainful .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Judgment gives
place to measurement, and then passes to new fields.</p>

<h3>Analogy as a Guide.</h3>

<p class="chapstart">A conviction that has over and over again served the discoverer
assures him that like causes underlie effects which
seem diverse. When Thomas Young observed the recurrent bands
of darkness due to interferences of light, he at once detected a
parallel to the beats by which interferences of
sound produce silence. He was therefore persuaded
that light moves in waves as does sound,
that it is not, as Newton supposed, a material emission. A chapter
might be filled with examples of the same kind: let one suffice.</p>

<p>If an ordinary clothes-line, say twenty feet long, receives a
wave-impulse from the hand at one end, the motion will proceed
to the other end as a series of waves. If a rope twice as heavy
is used, a larger part of the original impulse will be received at
the remote end than in the first experiment. Of course, there
comes a limit to the thickness of the rope which may be thus employed;
we must not choose a ship&#8217;s cable for instance, but the
rope most effective in results is much heavier than one would suppose
before trial. Lord Rayleigh, in his treatise on the theory
of sound, has shown that according to Lagrange it is unnecessary
to thicken a cord when we wish to add to its weight; as an alternative
we may fasten weights upon it at due intervals, the whole
having less mass than if we used a heavy rope of equal effectiveness.
Just what intervals are best will depend upon the thickness
and rigidity of the cord, upon its length, the amount and kind of
wave committed to it, as shown by Professor Michael I. Pupin of
Columbia University, New York, who extended the mathematical
problem dealth with by Lagrange and Lord Rayleigh. In the singular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
efficiency of transmission thus studied he saw a principle
which, by analogy, he believed to hold true in the electrical field
as in mechanics. This principle he has illustrated in his paper
published in the Proceedings of the American Institute of Electrical
Engineers, 1900, page 215. In A of the accompanying <a href="#Fig225">figure</a>,
derived from that paper, is a tuning fork, C, with its handle
rigidly fixed. To one of its prongs is attached a flexible inextensible
cord, bd. Let the fork vibrate steadily by any suitable
means. The motion of the cord will be a wave motion, as in B.
The attenuation of the wave as it dies down is represented in C.
Experiments show that, other things being equal, increased density
of the string will diminish attenuation, because a larger mass requires
a smaller velocity in order to store up a given quantity of
kinetic energy, and smaller velocity brings with it a smaller frictional
loss. Moreover, as the string is increased in density, its
wave-length is shortened.</p>

<div class="figc450" id="Fig225">
<img src="images/illo419.png" alt="" width="450" height="355" />
<p class="caption">Prof. Pupin&#8217;s diagram explaining his system of long
distance telephony.</p>
</div>

<p>Suppose now that we attach a weight, say a ball of beeswax, at
the middle point of the string, so as to increase the vibrating mass.
This weight will become a source of reflections and less wave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
energy will reach the farther end of the string than before. Subdivide
the beeswax into three equal parts and place them at three
equi-distant points along the cord. The efficiency of transmission
will be better now than when all the wax was concentrated at a
single point. By subdividing still further the efficiency will be
yet more improved; but a point is soon reached when further subdivisions
produce very slight improvement. This point is reached
when the loaded cord vibrates nearly like a uniform cord of the
same mass, tension, and frictional resistance; such a cord, bearing
12 small weights of beeswax, is represented as D when at rest, as
E when in motion. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is impossible so to load a cord
as to make it suitable for waves of all lengths; but if the distribution
of the loads satisfies the requirements of a given wave-length,
it will also satisfy them for all longer wave-lengths.</p>

<p>A cord of this kind has mechanical analogy with an electrical
wave conductor. In a wire transmitting electricity inductance
coils may be so placed as to have just the effect of the bits of wax
attached to the cord in our illustration; in both cases the waves
are transmitted more fully and with less blurring than in an unloaded
line. The mathematical law of both cases is the same.
It was in ascertaining that law so as to know where to place his
inductance coils that Professor Pupin arrived at success. Preceding
inventors, missing this law, came only to failure. He constructed
an artificial cable of 250 sections, each consisting of a
sheet of paraffined paper on both sides of which was a strip of
tin-foil, the whole fairly representing a cable 250 miles in length.
At each of the 250 joints in the course of this artificial circuit he
inserted a twin inductance coil wound on one spool 125 millimetres
broad and high, and separated by cardboard <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>64</sub> inch
thick. Each coil had 580 turns of No. 20 Brown &amp; Sharpe wire.
Just as with the weighted rope this circuit transmitted its current
much more efficiently than if the inductance coils had been absent.</p>

<p>This artificial cable, when without coils, through a distance
equal to fifty miles of ordinary line worked well, up to seventy-five
miles it served fairly well, but proved impracticable at 100
miles, and impossible at distances exceeding 112 miles: all this
in exact correspondence with an actual line of the same length.
Over a uniform telephone line an increase of distance interferes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
with the transmission of speech, not only by diminishing the
volume of sound, but also from the rapid loss of articulation. At
first this manifests itself as an apparent lowering of vocal pitch.
In Professor Pupin&#8217;s experiments an assistant&#8217;s voice at the end
of 75 miles of uniform cable sounded like a strong baritone; at
100 miles it became drummy so that it was understood with difficulty,
although the speaker had his mouth close to the transmitter,
and spoke as loudly as if he were addressing a large
audience. At more than 112 miles nothing but the lowest notes
of his voice could be heard, the articulation was entirely gone.
As soon as the coils were inserted the drumminess ceased, and
conversation could be carried on as rapidly as one chose through
the whole circuit of 112 miles. Drumminess is due to the obliteration
of the overtones, long distance transmission weakening these
overtones much more than it does the low fundamental tones.
The addition of coils makes the rate of weakening the same for
all vibrations, hence the transmitted sound has the same character
at the end of the line as at the beginning.</p>

<p>In practice Professor Pupin&#8217;s method has proved a remarkable
success. In ordinary circuits it reduces materially the quantity
of wire necessary. Where a circuit is unusually long it assures
clearness of tones or of signals at distances previously out of
the question. It makes possible telephony across the Atlantic: a
cable for this service would cost only one fourth more than an
ordinary telegraphic cable as now laid and used. A decided advantage
is reaped by its use in underground cables, liable as they
are to a serious blurring of currents at distances comparatively
short. The intervals at which inductance coils should be placed
depend upon the circumstances of each case. These are discussed
by Professor Pupin in the paper here mentioned.</p>

<h3>Rules that Work Both Ways.</h3>

<p>Analogy in many a path such as that of Professor Pupin has
served as a guide to the discoverer and inventor. Equally gainful
has been the conviction that many rules
work both ways, so that ingenuity has only to
execute the converse or the reverse of a familiar
task in order to abridge toil, or reach a
prize wholly new.</p>

<p>A crow wishes to get at a clam which it has dug out of the sand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
To break the stout shell is beyond the strength of its bill, so the
knowing bird flies aloft, lets the clam fall on a rocky beach or a
stone and forthwith enjoys a meal. It makes no difference
whether a hammer falls on the shell, or the shell falls on a hammer:
the crow takes the one method within its power. So with
the wood-chopper whose axe becomes imbedded in a stick of
birch or maple: he lifts wood and axe together as high as he can,
then lets the axe fall on its back, when the shock instantly tears
the stick apart. Drilling in a lathe is usually executed by the
screw of the poppet advancing during the process. In boring
long holes, the object to be bored is rotated and moved in a
straight line, while the tool advances without revolving. In an
emergency William Fairbairn, the famous engineer, had in hand
a large task of riveting. He took a punching machine, reversed
its action, and had a riveting machine which turned out work
twelve times as fast as a skilful workman.</p>

<p>As in the machine shop so in transportation. One of the notions
of the pioneer railway engineers in England was that their rails
must be flanged, for how else could wheels remain on the track?
But somebody with breadth of view-point asked, Why not leave
the rail flat, or nearly so, and put the flange on the wheel, an
easier thing to do? Accordingly to the wheel the flange went
and there it stays, to remind the traveler of the Eastern maxim:
&#8220;To him who is well shod
it is as if the whole world
were covered with leather.&#8221;</p>

<p>In many tasks we have a
like choice of methods. We
wish to measure the velocity
of a stream; if we immerse
a bent glass tube so that its
horizontal part is upstream,
the height to which
the water rises in the upright
half of the tube will tell us what we wish to know; if we
reverse the tube, a sinking instead of a rising in the upright glass
will measure the speed of our current.</p>

<h3>Turbines Reversed.</h3>

<p>For many years turbines have proved themselves better than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
other water-wheels, so that wherever an old-fashioned breast-wheel
still goes its creaking round, there the
sketcher seizes the picturesque outlines of a
motor whose remaining days are few. A turbine
in carefully curved vanes gets from falling water all the
power it holds; when the task is to lift water, then this very
turbine, reversed in direction, is the Worthington pump, the most
efficient water-lifter known. The rules for construction are the
same whether we start with falling water and derive power from
it, or begin with power and raise water thereby. Quite as pictorial
as a breast-wheel is a wind-mill, the older the better, thinks
the artist as he views its weather-beaten frame. Much later than
the wind-mill as a device is its counterpart, the fan-blower; the
lines most effective for the one are also best for the other. Much
more effective than the old-time mills of but four arms are new
mills whose whole circle is covered by blades. Fan-blowers with
a like multiplicity of vanes, yield most duty.</p>

<h3>Hydraulic Pressure as a Counterbalance.</h3>

<p>For ages one of the observations of every day has been that
a column of water exerts pressure in proportion to its height.
Usually this pressure is thought of as being
exerted downward, but if a pipe, filled with
water at great pressure, be curved upward at
its base, then the contained liquid presses upward.
Mark the gain of thus varying a little from the ordinary
view point of a case. In 1883 Mr. J. F. Holloway, of California,
set up a turbine with its stream admitted from below and moving
upward through the vanes of the machine. He thus obliged the
water pressure to aid in supporting the wheel, materially diminishing
its friction through thus counterbalancing its weight. This
plan has been adopted at Niagara Falls for the gigantic turbines
there erected, among the most powerful in the world.</p>

<h3>Engine and Pump.</h3>

<p>That simple appliance, a garden squirt, exemplifies two important
kinds of apparatus, one the converse of the other. Fill
the cylinder with water, force the piston along
its course, and you have a pump. Admit water
under pressure, as from a city faucet, and it
drives the piston of a motor; in principle such is the mechanism
of thousands of motors in London, using water under a pressure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
of 500 pounds, or so, to the square inch. An apparatus, essentially
the same, when supplied with steam or gas becomes the familiar
engine at work in uncounted factories and mills. It was a great
advance in steam engine design when the single cylinder of Watt
was replaced by two or more cylinders, using steam at high instead
of low pressure. Thus apportioned in a series of cylinders
the steam is not nearly as much cooled, with loss of working
power, as when but one cylinder is used. So likewise, it is best to
divide the compressing of air into two or more stages, so that at
each stage the air may be cooled, and thus more easily compressed
than if a single operation completed the business. The best air
compressor is virtually the converse of a steam engine.</p>

<p>Of late years reciprocating machinery, of one kind and another,
has had to give place to rotary designs. In these, as in
their predecessors, are striking cases of rules that work both
ways. If steam at high pressure is fully to yield its energy in a
Parsons-Westinghouse turbine, for example, the vanes must be
rightly curved, and there must be a succession of them in circles
gradually widened so that the steam may part with its energy, a
step at a time. In mining, in metallurgy, in many another great
industry, compressed air is required in huge volumes. For its
production Mr. Parsons has invented an apparatus virtually the
twin of his steam turbine, only that it runs in a reversed direction;
it may be directly yoked to a steam turbine.</p>

<h3>Fans.</h3>

<p>Currents of air much less forceful than those of steam in a
turbine are generated by the electric fans of our shops and offices.
When their vanes move as the hands of a clock,
a breeze comes toward you; reverse their
motion and the stream blows away from you.
Place such a fan in the side of a box otherwise closed; driven
in one direction the vanes force air into the box; driven the opposite
way the vanes remove air from the box. Powerful currents
of this kind, such as stream from a Sturtevant blower, are used
for blast furnaces and the largest steam installations. The engineer
chooses between two methods; he can seal up the fire-room
and force in air which will find its way through the grate-bars to
the fuel, or he places a fan in the smoke-stack to induce a current<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
by exhaustion. In New York and London underground pneumatic
tubes carry letters to and from the post-offices. When the
central engine works its fans exhaustively, water may be drawn
into the tubes from the streets so as to do much harm. When the
ground is thoroughly dry it is best to exhaust the air at one end
of the line and compress it at the other. This union of a push
and a pull resembles Lord Kelvin&#8217;s plan in ocean telegraphy, by
which a cable is first connected with the negative pole of a battery
and then, for a signal, made to touch the positive pole. With its
path thus cleared, a message pulses along at a redoubled pace.</p>

<h3>Electrical Reciprocity.</h3>

<p>Electrical art teems with rules that work both ways. Oersted
observed that a current traversing a wire deflects a nearby compass
needle. Faraday, with the guiding law of
reciprocity ever in mind, forcibly deflected a
magnetic needle so as to create a current in a
neighboring wire by the motion of his hand. He thus discovered
magneto-electricity, in Tyndall&#8217;s opinion the greatest result
ever obtained by an experiment. On the simple principle then
discovered by Faraday are built the huge generators that revolve
at Niagara, at power-houses large and small throughout the
world, for the production of electricity by mechanical motion. A
compass needle has a field, or breadth of influence, surrounding its
surface, which is small and weak. A monster magnet in a generator
has a field at once large and strong. When an electrical
conductor, such as a coil of copper wire, is forcibly rotated in
that field, powerful currents of electricity arise in the wire,
equivalent as energy to the mechanical effort of rotation. Take
another case: a current decomposes water; the resulting gases as
they combine yield just such a current as that which parted them.
Join a strip of bismuth to a strip of antimony, and let a current
traverse the pair; the junction will become heated. At another
time, using no current, touch that joint with the hand for a
moment; the communicated warmth, though trifling in amount,
creates a current plainly revealed by a galvanometer, affording
a delicate means of detecting minute changes of temperature. In
1874 M. Gramme showed four of his dynamos at the Vienna Exhibition.
M. Fontaine, an electrician, saw a pair of loose wires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
near one of the machines and attached them to its terminals; the
other ends of the wires happened to be connected with a dynamo
in swift rotation. Immediately the newly attached machine began
to revolve in a reverse direction as a motor. Thus by an accident,
wisely followed up, did electricity add itself to motive
powers, establishing an industry now of commanding importance.</p>

<p>In the chemical effects of a current we have parallel facts. Expose
a nickel-iron plate to the alkaline bath of an Edison storage
cell; at once the metal begins to dissolve, yielding a current. Now
send a slightly stronger current into that plate; forthwith the
plate picks out iron-nickel from its compounds in the liquid, growing
fast to its original bulk. So many cases of this kind occur
that chemists believe that synthesis and electrolysis are always
counterparts. Be that as it may, we must remember that often
chemical action is much more intricate than it seems to be at first
sight. Thus in dry air, or even in dry oxygen, iron is unattacked;
but bring in a little moisture and at once oxidation proceeds
with rapid pace. So with the combustible gases emerging
from the throat of a blast furnace; they refuse to burn until they
meet a whiff of steam, when they instantly burst into flame.
Chemical energy usually moves in a labyrinth which the chemist
may be able to thread only in one direction. A retracing of his
steps is for the day when he will know much more than he does
now.</p>

<h3>Ovens and Safes.</h3>

<p>Properties purely physical, and therefore much simpler than
those studied by the chemist, offer us noteworthy instances of
rules that work both ways. For years the walls
and doors of safes and bank vaults have been
filled with gypsum as a substance all but impervious
to heat. To-day Norwegian cooking chests, on much
the same principle, are attracting public attention by their economy.
A pot is filled with, let us say, the materials for soup, it is
brought to a boil, and then placed in a chest thickly clad with a
non-conducting coat of felt or even of hay, as illustrated on page
189. In an hour or so a capital soup is found to have cooked itself
simply by its own retained heat. A resource long familiar
to the builder of safes and strong-boxes is thus taken into household
service with much profit. It is plain that whatever obstructs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
the passing of heat may be employed either to keep it in or keep it
out. For years inventors busied themselves in finding non-conductors
wherewith to cover steam-pipes and steam-boilers. To-day,
in cold storage plants, these non-conductors are just as useful
in covering pipes filled with circulating liquids of freezing
temperatures. Take a parallel case in the field of physical research.
In 1873 Dulong and Petit in their measurement of heat
avoided losses of heat with a new approach to perfection by using
glass vessels one inside another, with exhausted spaces in between.
In 1892 Professor Dewar applied this device to keeping
liquefied gases, of extremely low temperatures, from being
warmed by surrounding bodies, an aim just the converse of that
of Dulong and Petit. Often, as in these cases, the applications of
a quality may come in pairs; one invention may suggest its twin.</p>

</div>

<p>This convertibility of principle may be observed as clearly in the
phenomena of nature as in the creations of ingenuity. Water
expands as it freezes; when this expansion takes place freely,
the freezing temperature is 0&deg; C., but when expansion is resisted,
as when the water is confined in a strong gun-barrel, the freezing
temperature is lowered, for now the ice has to do work in the act
of crystallization. So with the boiling points of liquids; they rise
as atmospheric pressure increases, they fall as atmospheric
pressure is reduced. A prospector on Pike&#8217;s Peak cannot boil
an egg in his kettle. Next day he descends a mine in the valley,
to find the boiling point higher than when he built his fire beside
the mouth of the mine.</p>

<h3>Cube Root Easily Found.</h3>

<p>Take another example of inversion, this time in the field of
mensuration. Every schoolboy knows that cubes respectively
one, two, three, and four inches in diameter
have contents respectively of one, eight,
twenty-seven, and sixty-four cubic inches;
that is, the contents vary as the cubes of the diameters of these
solids. This is true of all solids alike in form. Cones, therefore,
which have an angle of let us say fifteen degrees at the apex,
vary in contents as the cube of their heights. Cones usually are
looked at as they rest on their bases; it is worth while to consider
them reversed, pointing downward. An inverted cone, duly supported
on a frame allowing motion upward and downward, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
dipping into a cylinder partly filled with water, is a simple means
of extracting cube root within say one and ten as limits. The
cone should be marked off into tenths, and the cylinder, between
high and low-water, into thousandths. On a similar plan a
tapering wedge acts as a square-root extractor, displacing water
as the square of its depth of immersion.</p>

<h3>From Effect to Cause.</h3>

<p>A mechanic, no less than a geometer, may show sagacity in
taking up a question in reverse, and reasoning from effect to
cause. An expert printer examines a spoiled
sheet as it leaves the press, observing that it is
smeared and crumpled with a decided skew.
At once he stops the machinery and puts his finger on a lever that
has become crooked, or on the wheel that has been strained out
of true. Mr. Joseph V.
Woodworth says of milling
cutters<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;When a cutter is
broken by being wrongly
run backwards on to the
work, the breakage is characteristic.
Although the man
who broke it will be absolutely
sure that it ran in
the right direction, the
cracks down the face of the
teeth tell a different story.&#8221;</p>

<p>In his manual on steel,
Mr. William Metcalf reads
a record equally legible to a
trained eye<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;If an axe,
after tempering, is found
cracked near the corners of
its edge, these corners have
been hotter than the middle of the blade. If a crack appears at
the middle of the edge, there the heat was greater than at the
corners; snipping and comparing the grains will tell the story.
If a somewhat straight crack is noticed, near the edge and parallel
thereto, the chances are that the crack indicates a seam.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point let us for a few moments leave the field of
mechanics, and notice how inferring cause from effect may aid
students of rocks, of the heavens, of the human frame. A geologist,
observing a dense limestone, learns how severe the pressure
which brought loose sediment to this compactness. In the glass-like
texture of quartz he finds an equally plain record of intense
heat. The scorings on rock-surfaces, in lines from northward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
to southward, disclose to him the paths in which ages ago the
glaciers moved from their birth-places in the polar zones. In
astronomy a feat of inference incomparably more difficult was
accomplished by John Couch Adams and Urbain Leverrier, each
independently of the other. The orbit of Uranus displayed certain
minute irregularities which they referred to a planet, at that
time not as yet observed, whose place they indicated. Their remarkable
inference was verified by the discovery of Neptune on
September 23, 1846.</p>

<p>In a path remote indeed from that of the observer of planet and
star, the surgeon in much the same way reasons from result to
cause. In 1870 Fritsch and Bitzig, two German investigators,
observed that in applying an electric shock to a well defined area
of the brain of a chloroformed dog, its limbs moved. One part
of the brain thus excited would cause the fore-leg to twitch, another
part would lead the hind-leg to move. When a specific area
of the animal&#8217;s brain was taken away, a corresponding part of its
body&mdash;the eyes, ears, or limbs, were permanently paralyzed. From
studies thus begun it has been clearly proved that in the brain
of animals there is a division of labor, each activity being as
much localized within the skull as it is externally in the nose,
ears, or feet. The examination of human victims of disease and
injury has confirmed all this. A patient may have suffered loss
of power to write, to speak, to stand firmly on his feet, for weeks
or months before the end. The cause in many cases is found to
be a tumor, sometimes no larger than a pea, which has pressed
down upon a particular area of the brain and so given rise to the
trouble. A depressed fragment of bone in fracture of the skull
has a similar effect. With these facts in mind, when a surgeon is
called in to treat a patient who is suffering from loss of power to
write, speak or stand, he lifts the sufferer&#8217;s skull for a small space
over the specially indicated area, relieving the depressed fracture,
or exposing the small tumor, which he removes, usually with
restoration to health.</p>

<p>A generation ago much was said about functional diseases, it
being supposed that apart from the mechanism of bone, muscle or
nerve, the bodily functions might go astray of themselves. Improvements
in the microscope have shown that many of these derangements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
are due to diseases of structure; and beyond the
range of the microscope a careful study of symptoms enables the
physician to infer that physical structures are affected in modes
which, one of these days, he may be able to see and picture.</p>

<p>An eminent oculist, Dr. Casey A. Wood of Chicago, tells me
that certain diseases of the brain and kidneys derange the sight
in a way clearly revealed by an opthalmoscope, a small instrument
by which the interior of the eye may be explored through
the pupil. Thus a patient complaining of imperfect vision may
be really suffering from an ailment involving much more than
the eyes.</p>

<p>A noteworthy group of physicians devote themselves to the
care of the insane, that is, of patients whose brains are diseased.
As a general rule when insanity declares itself, manners depart
first, then morals, and finally the physical powers of the eye, the
ear, the hand. All in reverse telling the story of how mankind
became human; first in developing the faculties shared with bird
and beast, then in rearing character, and at last, in adding the
graces of behavior.</p>

<h3>Profit in Contraries.</h3>

<p>From this digression into matters of astronomy and of the
human body and mind, let us return to the workshop and the
engine-room. There is gain, as we have seen,
when an inventor takes a familiar process,
like planing, and reverses it, so that instead of
the plane moving across a board, the board is moved beneath a
planer. Not seldom, too, profit has followed upon adopting a
plan just the contrary of a time-honored practice, as when a
Frenchman pierced a needle with an eye near its point instead of
away from its point, taking a step that did much to make the sewing-machine
a possibility. Guns were loaded at the muzzle for
ages, until one day a man of daring loaded them at the breech, to
find that method preferable in every way. A bullet or ball might
then be larger and closer in fit than before, have greater velocity
and penetration, while truer in flight, especially if sped from a
rifled gun. Anything left in the gun was in front of the new
charge instead of behind it. In manufacture, the perishable parts
of the gun, its vent and the adjacent steel, are now in a movable
breech-piece where they may be replaced with little cost and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
trouble. Loading and firing may be much more rapid than with
muzzle-loaders, while less space is required and the gunners are
much less exposed than formerly. And ages before there was
such a thing as a firearm, a vast stride in tilling the ground was
taken simply by reversing an ancient practice. At first the soil
was scratched by a stick drawn along its surface; when some
primeval Edison gave the stick a forward instead of a backward
thrust he created the plow, and tillage began in earnest.</p>

<p>In feeding coal to a fire, as in the case of a common grate, the
one plan for centuries was to add the fuel from above. As
gradually heated by the glowing mass beneath it, this fresh fuel
sent forth comparatively cool gases which, to a considerable extent,
passed into the chimney without being burnt. A mechanical
stoker of the underfeed type forces fresh coal beneath the fuel
already aglow; the result is that all the gases from the fresh coal
pass through an incandescent bed which heats them highly, so
that on emergence into the air-current they are thoroughly consumed.</p>

<div class="figc600" id="Fig230">
<img src="images/illo434.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="352" />
<p class="caption">Link Belt Machinery Co.&#8216;s Shop, Chicago,
showing Sturtevant ventilating and heating apparatus.</p>
</div>

<p>In large machine shops a heating system is finding favor which
equally departs from traditional methods. In a small workshop
piping filled with steam or hot water serves well enough: in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
lofty machine shop it serves badly, sending as it does warm currents
of air toward the roof where warmth does only harm. The
union of a fan with a system of steam coils introduces a vast improvement.
Air warmed to any desired temperature is carried in
ducts throughout the building, with outlets at the points most in
need of heat. Instead of being allowed to take its way to the
roof, the warmed air is forcibly directed to the floor which otherwise
would be unduly cool. Because the air is in rapid motion
the heating coils may not be more than one fourth as extensive
as for a system of direct radiation. This plan has the further advantage
of utilizing exhaust steam without producing undue back
pressure on the pumps or engines, and yields results almost equal
to those from live steam. See accompanying <a href="#Fig230">illustration</a>.</p>

<p>Lighting as well as heating may share the gain of changing
an old method for its contrary. Many forms of reflectors, both in
glass and metal, have been designed to scatter the beams of lamps,
usually in a downward direction. An excellent plan directs the
positive carbon of an arc-lamp to the ceiling instead of to the
floor; from the ceiling, duly whitened, the rays descend more
thoroughly and agreeably diffused than if reflected from mirrors
or refracted by prisms, however ingeniously shaped and disposed.
See <a href="#Fig86">illustration</a> on page 75.</p>

<p>In the days of small things in engineering, which ended only
with Watt and his steam engine, when a kettle was to be heated
the proper place for its fire was thought to be outside. But when
big boilers came in, with urgent need that their contents be heated
with all despatch, it was found gainful to put the fire inside.
Stephenson owed no small part of the success of his locomotive,
the &#8220;Rocket,&#8221; to its boiler being outside its flame. The most
efficient modern boilers fully develop this principle.</p>

<p>In an ordinary furnace the draft moves upward, obeying the
impulse due to the lightness of its heated gases. This direction
is reversed in down-draft furnaces which were originally devised
by Lord Dundonald more than a century ago. In their modern
types a fan blast forces the draft downward through the fuel,
with the effect that the gases are so intensely heated as to be
thoroughly burned. The grate-bars are of water-tube, connected
to the boiler as part and parcel of its heating surface. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
Loomis gas-producer a like method is adopted: the fuel is charged
through an open door in the top of the generator and the gas is
exhausted from the bottom of the fire. Thus all tarry and
volatile matter in bituminous coal or wood is converted into a
fixed gas.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago one would have supposed the wheels of ordinary
carts and carriages to be safe from change, to be among the
heirlooms secure of transmission to
posterity. Not so. Observe the wheel
of a bicycle and note that instead of
stout spokes upholding the hub, there
are thin steel wires from which the
hub is suspended. Thus strength is
gained while the wheel is lightened
and material economized. Wheels of
like model are now used in many
other vehicles where lightness is
particularly desired. This plan of
using spokes in tension instead of in
compression is credited to Leonardo
da Vinci who flourished four centuries
ago.</p>

<h3>Judgment in Theorizing: Rules Have Limits.</h3>

<p>While the men who add to known truth, whether in the realm
of matter or of mind, must build on acquired knowledge, they do
so with common sense, by exercise of the
supreme faculty of judgment. To begin with,
they perceive that every force acts within limits,
acts concurrently with other forces which
modify its effects. Speaking of gravity Professor
William James says<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;A pendulum may be deflected by
a single blow and swing back. Will it swing back the more often,
the more we multiply the blows? No. For if they rain upon the
pendulum too fast it will not swing at all, but remain deflected in
a sensibly stationary state. Increasing the cause numerically
need not increase numerically the effect. Blow through a tube;
you get a certain musical note; and increasing the blowing increases
for a certain time the loudness of the note. Will this be
true indefinitely? No; for when a certain force is reached, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
note, instead of growing louder, suddenly disappears and is replaced
by its higher octave. Turn on the gas slightly and light
it; you get a tiny flame. Turn on more gas and the flame increases.
Will this relation increase indefinitely? No, again; for
at a certain moment up shoots the flame into a ragged streamer
and begins to hiss.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a spirit as judicial Sir William Anderson has said<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;There
is a tendency among the young and inexperienced to put blind
faith in formul&aelig;, forgetting that most of them are based upon
premises which are not accurately reproduced in practice, and
which in many cases are unable to take into account collateral disturbances,
which only experience can foresee, and common sense
guard against.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Do Not Pay More than 100 Cents for a Dollar.</h3>

<p>That, with regard to a new machine, all the facts of constructive
and working cost should be in view, and after tests in practice,
is the conviction of Professor A. B. W.
Kennedy<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;Machines cannot be finally criticized,
pronounced good or bad, simply from
results measurable in a laboratory. One wishes
to use a steam plant, for example, by which as
little coal shall be burnt as possible. But clearly it would be
worth while to waste a certain amount of coal if a less economical
machine would allow a larger saving in the cost of repairs or of
interest. Or, it might be worth while to use a machine in which
a certain amount of extra power was obviously employed, if only
by means of such a machine the cost of attendance could be measurably
reduced. The &#8216;worth-whileness&#8217; of economies comes out
only in practical experience. A careful training in comparatively
simple parts fits a man more than anything else to gauge accurately
the importance of such parts as those named. No doubt
there are many men in whom the critical faculty is insufficiently
developed to allow them ever to be of use in these matters, but to
those who are intellectually capable of &#8216;the higher criticism&#8217; it is
of inestimable value to have had a systematic training in the
lower.&#8221;</p>

<p>To the same effect are remarks by Professor J. Hopkinson<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;Doubling
the thickness of a cylinder by no means doubles its
strength. Conversely, doubling the strength of the material will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
permit the thickness to be diminished to much less than one half.
Until 1869 hydraulic presses were mostly made of cast iron.
There was much astonishment at the great reduction in thickness
and weight which became possible when steel was substituted for
the weaker material. In the case of guns it is well-known that
greater strength can be obtained if the outer hoops are shrunken
on the inner ones. Mathematical theory tells us what amount of
shrinkage should give the best results. A gun may have a shrinkage
so great as to weaken it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He continues<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;Mathematical treatment of any problem is always
analytical&mdash;attention is concentrated upon certain facts, and
for the moment other facts are neglected. For example, in dealing
with the thermodynamics of the steam engine, one dismisses
from consideration very vital points essential to the successful
working of the engine&mdash;questions of strength of parts, lubrication,
convenience for repairs. But if an engineer is to succeed he
must not fail to consider every element necessary to success; he
must have a practical instinct which will tell him whether the
engine as a whole will succeed. His mind must not be only
analytical, or he will be in danger of solving bits of the problems
which his work presents, and of falling into fatal mistakes on
points which he has omitted to consider, and which the plainest,
intelligent, practical man would avoid almost without knowing it.
Again, the powers of the strongest mathematician being limited,
there is a constant temptation to fit the facts to suit the mathematics,
and to assume that the conclusions will have greater accuracy
than the premises from which they are deduced. This is a
trouble one meets with in other applications of mathematics to
experimental science. In order to make the subject amenable to
treatment, one finds, for example, in the science of magnetism,
that it is boldly assumed that the magnetization of magnetizable
material is proportionate to the magnetizing force, and the ratio
has a name given to it, and conclusions are drawn from the assumption;
but the fact is, no such proportionality exists, and all
conclusions resulting from the assumption are so far invalid.
Whenever possible the mathematical deductions should be frequently
verified by reference to observation and experiment, for
the very simple reason that they are only deductions, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
premises from which the deductions are drawn may be inaccurate
or incomplete. We must always remember that we cannot get
more out of the mathematical mill than we put into it, though we
may get it in a form infinitely more useful for our purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Professor Alexander Bain in his &#8220;Senses and the Intellect&#8221;
concludes<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;A sound judgment, meaning a clear and precise
perception of what is really effected by the contrivances employed,
is to be looked upon as the first requisite of the practical man.
He may be meagre in intellectual resources, he may be slow in
getting forward and putting together the appropriate devices, but
if his perception of the end is unfaltering and strong, he will do
no mischief and practice no quackery. He may have to wait long
in order to bring together the apposite machinery, but when he
has done so to the satisfaction of his own thorough judgment, the
success will be above dispute. Judgment is in general more important
than fertility; because a man by consulting others and
studying what has been already done, may usually obtain suggestions
enough, but if his judgment of the end is loose, the
highest exuberance of intellect is only a snare.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Judgment Moves to New Fields.</h3>

<p>As applied science rises to higher and higher planes, a good
many questions which were once matters of judgment, become
subjects of estimate, often precise. A century
ago the forms of ships were decided by sheer
sagacity; to-day, as we have seen in this book,
such forms are of definite approved types, each
adapted to specific needs, and never departed from by a prudent
designer except in slight and carefully noted variations. Such
examples may be drawn from many another field where science
and industry join hands, especially in every branch of modern
engineering. A new power-plant, in every detail of its installation,
is so standardized that a competent corps of erectors, from
any part of the civilized world, can readily put it together. Its
designers from first to last have sought to make operation easy,
and every working part &#8220;fool-proof.&#8221; In case of accident any
item of the structure broken or deranged can be supplied by the
builders at once.</p>

<p>All this does not mean that science in its onward march is
eliminating the need for judgment, but simply that judgment is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
constantly passing into territory wholly new. In devising gas-engines
of novel principle, in combining chemicals for new
economies of illumination, the faculty of judgment enters provinces
vastly broader than those from which it has retired as its approximations
have given place to exact measurements. Manual
skill has of late undergone a similar change of scope. Many a
modern machine performs hammering, punching, riveting more
effectively and swiftly than human hands, so that here an operator
of little skill replaces a mechanic of much skill. But in another
and higher field, deftness was never more in request than to-day.
In the final adjustments of a voltmeter, of a refractometer, in the
last polish given to an observatory lens, a delicacy of touch is
demanded compared with which the dexterity of an old-time
planisher or file-grinder is mere clumsiness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI<br />
NEWTON, FARADAY AND BELL AT WORK</h2>

<p class="chaptoc">Newton, the supreme generalizer .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Faraday, the master of experiment .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Bell, the inventor of the telephone, transmits speech by a beam
of light.</p>

<p class="chapstart">Having now taken a rapid general view of observation and
experiment, of the faculty of sound theorizing, let us enter
the presence of two great masters of research and invention, beginning
with a man who united the loftiest powers as a mathematician,
a physicist, and a generalizer.</p>

<h3>How Newton Discovered the Law of Gravitation.</h3>

<p>How Sir Isaac Newton discovered the law of gravitation is
thus told in his Life by Sir David Brewster<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;It was either in
1665 or 1666 that Newton&#8217;s mind was first
directed to the subject of gravity. He appears
to have left Cambridge some time before
August 8, 1665, when the college was dismissed
on account of the plague, and it was,
therefore, in the autumn of that year, and not in that of 1666, that
the apple is said to have fallen from the tree at Woolsthorpe, and
suggested to Newton the idea of gravity. When sitting alone in
the garden, and speculating on the power of gravity, it occurred
to him that, as the same power by which the apple fell to the
ground was not sensibly diminished at the greatest distance from
the centre of the earth to which we can reach, neither at the summits
of the loftiest spires, nor on the tops of the highest mountains,
it might extend to the moon and retain her in her orbit, in
the same manner as it bends into a curve the path of a stone or
a cannon ball, when projected in a straight line from the surface
of the earth. If the moon was thus kept in her orbit by gravitation,
or, in other words, its attraction, it was equally probable, he
thought, that the planets were kept in their orbits by gravitating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
towards the sun. Kepler had discovered the great law of the
planetary motions, that the squares of their periodic times were
as the cubes of their distances from the sun, and hence Newton
drew the important conclusion that the force of gravity, or attraction,
by which the planets were retained in their orbits, varied
as the square of their distances from the sun. Knowing the force
of gravity at the earth&#8217;s surface, he was, therefore, led to compare
it with the force exhibited in the actual motion of the moon,
in a circular orbit; but having assumed that the distance of the
moon from the earth was equal to sixty of the earth&#8217;s semi-diameters,
he found that the force by which the moon was drawn
from its rectilinear path in a second of time was only 13.9 feet,
whereas at the surface of the earth it was 16.1 in a second. This
great discrepancy between his theory and what he then considered
to be the fact, induced him to abandon the subject, and pursue
other studies with which he had been occupied.</p>

<p>&#8220;It does not distinctly appear at what time Newton became
acquainted with the more accurate measurement of the earth,
executed by Picard in 1670, and was thus led to resume his investigations.
Picard&#8217;s method of measuring his degree, and the
precise result which he obtained, were communicated to the Royal
Society, January 11, 1672, and the results of his observations and
calculations were published in the Philosophical Transactions for
1675. But whatever was the time when Newton became acquainted
with Picard&#8217;s measurement, it seems to be quite certain
that he did not resume his former thoughts concerning the moon
until 1684. Pemberton tells us, that &#8216;some years after he laid
aside&#8217; his former thoughts, a letter from Dr. Hooke put him on
inquiring what was the real figure in which a body, let fall from
any high place, descends, taking the motion of the earth round its
axis into consideration, and that this gave occasion to his resuming
his former thoughts concerning the moon, and determining, from
Picard&#8217;s recent measures, that &#8216;the moon appeared to be kept in
her orbit purely by the power of gravity.&#8217; But though Hooke&#8217;s
letter of 1679 was the occasion of Newton&#8217;s resuming his inquiries,
it does not fix the time when he employed the measures of
Picard. In a letter from Newton to Hailey, in 1686, he tells him
that Hooke&#8217;s letters in 1679 were the cause of his &#8216;finding the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
method of determining the figures, which, when I had tried in
the ellipsis, I threw the calculations by, being upon other studies;
and so it rested for about five years, till, upon your request, I
sought for the papers.&#8217; Hence Mr. Rigaud considers it clear, that
the figures here alluded to were the paths of bodies acted upon
by a central force, and that the same occasion induced him to
resume his former thoughts concerning the moon, and to avail
himself of Picard&#8217;s measures to correct his calculations. It was,
therefore, in 1684, that Newton discovered that the moon&#8217;s deflection
in a minute was sixteen feet, the same as that of bodies
at the earth&#8217;s surface. As his calculations drew to a close, he is
said to have been so agitated that he was obliged to desire a
friend to finish them.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Michael Faraday&#8217;s Method of Working.</h3>

<p>With no mathematics beyond simple arithmetic, Michael Faraday
displayed powers of experiment and generalization so extraordinary
that in these respects he stands at
the same height as Newton himself. In the
life of Michael Faraday, by Dr. J. H. Gladstone,
we are given his account of the great
physicist&#8217;s method of working<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The habit of Faraday was to think out carefully beforehand
the subject on which he was working, and to plan his mode of
attack. Then, if he saw that some new piece of apparatus was
needed, he would describe it fully to the instrument maker with a
drawing, and it rarely happened that there was any need of
alteration in executing the order. If, however, the means of experiment
existed already, he would give Anderson, his assistant,
a written list of the things he would require, at least a day before&mdash;for
Anderson was not to be hurried. When all was ready, he
would descend into the laboratory, give a quick glance round to
see that all was right, take an apron from the drawer, and rub
his hands together as he looked at the preparations made for his
work. There must be no tool on the table but such as he required.
As he began his face would be exceedingly grave, and
during the progress of an experiment all must be exceedingly
quiet; but if it was proceeding according to his wish, he would
commence to hum a tune, and sometimes to rock himself sideways,
balancing alternately on either foot. Then, too, he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
often talk to his assistant about the result he was expecting. He
would put away each tool in its own place as soon as done with,
or at any rate as soon as the day&#8217;s work was over, and he would
not unnecessarily take a thing away from its place. No bottle
was allowed to remain without its proper stopper; no open glass
might stand for a night without a paper cover; no rubbish was to
be left on the floor; bad smells were to be avoided if possible; and
machinery in motion was not to be permitted to grate. In working,
also, he was very careful not to employ more force than was
wanted to produce the effect. When his experiments were finished
and put away, he would leave the laboratory, and think
further about them upstairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was through this lifelong series of experiments that Faraday
won his knowledge and mastered the forces of nature. The
rare ingenuity of his mind was ably seconded by his manipulative
skill, while the quickness of his perceptions was equalled by
the calm rapidity of his movements. He had indeed a passion for
experimenting. This peeps out in the preface to the second edition
of his &#8216;Chemical Manipulation,&#8217; where he writes, &#8216;Being intended
especially as a book of instruction, no attempts were made
to render it pleasing, otherwise than by rendering it effectual; for
I concluded that, if the work taught clearly what it was intended
to inculcate, the high interest always belonging to a well-made or
successful experiment would be sufficient to give it all the requisite
charms, and more than enough to make it valuable in the
eyes of those for whom it was designed.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He could scarcely pass a gold leaf electrometer without
causing the leaves to diverge by a sudden flick from his silk handkerchief.
I recollect, too, his meeting me at the entrance to the
lecture theatre at Jermyn Street, when Lyon Playfair was giving
the first, or one of the first lectures ever delivered in the building.
&#8216;Let us go up here,&#8217; said he, leading me far away from the central
table. I asked him why he chose such an out-of-the-way place.
&#8216;Oh,&#8217; he replied, &#8216;we shall be able here to find out what are the
acoustic qualities of the room.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The simplicity of the means with which he made his experiments
was often astonishing, and was indeed one of the manifestations
of his genius. A good instance is thus narrated by Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
Frederick Arrow<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8216;When the electric light was first permanently
exhibited at Dungeness, on 6th June, 1862, a committee of the
Elder Brethren, of which I was one, accompanied Faraday to
observe it. Before we left Dover, Faraday showed me a little
common paper box and said, &#8220;I must take care of this; it&#8217;s my
special photometer,&#8221;&mdash;and then, opening it, produced a lady&#8217;s ordinary
black shawl pin (jet, or imitation, perhaps)&mdash;and then
holding it a little way off the candle, showed me the image very
distinct; and then, putting it a little further off, placed another
candle near it, and the relative distance was shown by the size of
the image.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;In lecturing to the young he delighted to show how easily
apparatus might be extemporized. Thus, in order to construct
an electrical machine, he once inverted a four-legged stool to
serve for the stand, and took a white glass bottle for the cylinder.
A cork was fastened into the mouth of this bottle, and a bung was
fastened with sealing wax to the other end: into the cork was inserted
a handle for rotating the bottle, and in the centre of the
bung was a wooden pivot on which it turned: while with some
stout wire he made crutches on two of the legs of the stool for
the axles of this glass cylinder to work upon. The silk rubber
he held in his hand. A japanned tea cannister resting on a glass
tumbler formed the conductor, and the collector was the head of
a toasting fork. With this apparently rough apparatus he exhibited
all the rudimentary experiments in electricity to a large
audience.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Faraday&#8217;s Orderliness and Imagination.</h3>

<p>Faraday, in addition to the rarest ability in experiment, had an
orderliness of mind which gave the utmost effectiveness to his
work in every department. His successor,
Professor John Tyndall, says<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Faraday&#8217;s sense of order ran like a luminous
beam through all the transactions of his
life. The most entangled and complicated matters fell into harmony
in his hands. His mode of keeping accounts excited the
admiration of the managing board of the Royal Institution. And
his science was similarly ordered. In his Experimental Researches
he numbered every paragraph, and welded their various
parts together by incessant reference. His private notes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
Experimental Researches which are happily preserved, are
similarly numbered; their last paragraph bears the number 16,041.
His working qualities, moreover, showed the tenacity of the
Teuton. His nature was impulsive, but there was a force behind
the impulse which did not permit it to retreat. If in his warm
moments he formed a resolution, in his cool ones he made that
resolution good. Thus his fire was that of a solid combustible,
not that of a gas, which blazes suddenly, and dies as suddenly
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Faraday had exalted powers of imagination and as he gazed at
the curves in which iron-filings disposed themselves when tapped
on a card held above a magnet, he saw similar &#8220;lines of force&#8221;
surrounding every attracting mass of whatever kind. Other observers
had confined their attention to what takes place, or is
supposed to take place, in a conductor; he closely scanned what
took place around a conductor. He was thus addressed in a letter
from that remarkable physicist, Professor James Clerk Maxwell
of Cambridge<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;As far as I know you are the first person in whom the idea of
bodies acting at a distance by throwing the surrounding medium
into a state of constraint has arisen, as a principle to be actually
believed in. We have had streams of hooks and eyes flying
around magnets, and even pictures of them so beset; but nothing
is clearer than your description of all sources of force keeping up
a state of energy in all that surrounds them, which state by its increase
or diminution measures the work done by any change in
the system. You seem to see the lines of force curving round obstacles
and driving plump at conductors, and swerving toward
certain directions in crystals, and carrying with them everywhere
the same amount of attractive power, spread wider or denser as
the lines widen or contract. You have seen that the great mystery
is, not how like bodies repel and unlike attract, but how like bodies
attract by gravitation. But if you can get over that difficulty
either by making gravity the residual of the two electricities or
by simply admitting it, then your lines of force can &#8216;weave a web
across the sky&#8217; and lead the stars in their courses without any
necessarily immediate connection with the objects of their attraction. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>

<h3>How Light Becomes a Bearer of Speech.</h3>

<p>Michael Faraday, as we have seen, by researches of consummate
ability laid the foundation of modern electrical science and
art. In that field there is to-day no inventor
more illustrious than Professor Alexander
Graham Bell, the creator of the telephone, that
simplest and most important of electrical devices.<a name="FNanchor_34"
id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
Not content with obliging a wire to carry speech in electric
waves, Professor Bell has impressed beams of light into the
same service. The successive steps by which he arrived at the
photophone are of extraordinary interest. His story as given in
the proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science, 1880, is here somewhat condensed<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_34" id="Footnote_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> Professor Bell&#8217;s narrative of how he invented the telephone is given in
&#8220;Invention and Discovery,&#8221; one of the six volumes of &#8220;Little Masterpieces
of Science,&#8221; Doubleday, Page &amp; Co., New York. In &#8220;Flame, Electricity
and the Camera&#8221; by the present writer, published by the same firm, is a
chapter describing the telephone in its later developments. This chapter
was revised by the late Professor Alexander Melville Bell, father of the
inventor.</p></div>

<p>&#8220;In bringing before you some discoveries by Mr. Sumner
Tainter and myself, which have resulted in the production and
reproduction of sound by means of light, let me sketch the state
of knowledge which formed the starting point of our experiments.
I shall first describe selenium, and the uses of it devised
by previous experimenters; our researches have so widened the
class of substances sensitive, like selenium, to light-vibrations
that this sensitiveness seems to be a property of all matter. We
have found this property in gold, silver, platinum, iron, steel,
brass, copper, zinc, lead, antimony, german-silver, ivory, celluloid,
gutta percha, hard and soft rubber, paper, parchment, wood, mica,
and silvered glass. At first carbon and microscope glass seemed
insensitive; later experiments proved them to be no exceptions to
the rule.</p>

<p>&#8220;We find that when a vibratory beam of light falls upon these
substances they emit sounds, the pitch of which depends upon
the frequency of the vibratory change in the light. We also find
that when we control the form or character of the light-vibrations,
we control the quality of the sound, and obtain all varieties of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
articulate speech. We can thus speak from station to station
wherever we can project a beam of light. Selenium, indispensable
in the apparatus, was discovered by Berzelius in 1817. It is a
metalloid resembling tellurium; they differ, however, in electrical
properties; tellurium is a good conductor, selenium in its usual
forms is a non-conductor. Knox, in 1837, discovered that selenium
is a conductor when fused; in 1851, Hittorf showed that it conducts
when in one of its allotropic forms. When selenium is
rapidly cooled from a fused condition it is a non-conductor. In
this vitreous form it is dark brown, almost black by reflected light,
having an exceedingly brilliant surface; in thin films it is transparent,
and appears of a beautiful ruby red by transmitted light.
When selenium is cooled from fusion with extreme slowness, it
presents an entirely different appearance, being of a dull lead
color, and having throughout a granular or crystalline structure
and looking like a metal. It is now opaque even in very thin
films. It was this kind of selenium that Hittorf found to be a
conductor of electricity at ordinary temperatures. He also noticed
that its resistance to the passage of electricity diminished continuously
by heating up to the point of fusion; and that the resistance
suddenly increased as the solid passed to liquidity. It was
early discovered that exposure to sunlight hastens the change of
selenium from one allotropic form to another; an observation of
significance in the light of recent discoveries.</p>

<h3>The Cardinal Discovery.</h3>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Willoughby Smith, an engineer engaged in the laying of
submarine cables, had devised a system of testing and signalling
during their submersion. For this system, in
1872, it occurred to him that he might employ
crystalline selenium, on account of its high resistance,
at the shore end of a cable. On experiment the selenium
was found to have all the resistance required; some of the bars
displayed a resistance of 1400 megohms, as much as would be
offered by a telegraph wire long enough to reach from the earth
to the sun. But this resistance was found to be extremely variable;
the reason was disclosed when Mr. May, an assistant, observed
that the resistance of selenium is less in light than in
darkness. This discovery created widespread interest throughout
the world. Among the investigators who at once turned their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
attention to the subject was Professor W. G. Adams of King&#8217;s
College, London, who proved that the action on selenium is
chiefly due to the luminous rays of the spectrum, the ultra-red
and ultra-violet rays having little or no effect. Dr. Werner
Siemens, the eminent German physicist, produced a variety of
selenium fifteen times more conductive in sunlight than in darkness.
This extraordinary sensitiveness was brought about by
heating for some hours at a temperature of 210&deg; C., followed by
extremely slow cooling.</p>

<p class="caption">Telephones receiving sounds through a beam of light.</p>
</div>

<h3>The Telephone Brought in.</h3>

<p>&#8220;Observations concerning the effect of light upon the conductivity
of selenium had employed the galvanometer solely; it
occurred to me that the telephone, from its
extreme sensitiveness, might be substituted
with advantage. On consideration I saw that
the experiments could not be conducted in the
ordinary way with continuous light, for a good reason: the law
of audibility of the telephone is precisely analogous to the law of
electrical induction. No effect is produced during the passage of
a continuous and steady current. It is only at the moment of
change from a stronger to a weaker state, or, vice versa, that any
audible effect is produced; this effect is exactly proportional to
the amount of variation in the current. It was, therefore, evident
that the telephone could only respond to the effect produced in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
selenium at the moment of change from light towards darkness,
or <i>vice versa</i>, and that it would be advisable to intermit the light
with great rapidity so as to produce a succession of changes in
the conductivity of the selenium corresponding in frequency to
musical vibrations within the limits of the sense of hearing. For
I had often noticed that currents of electricity, so feeble as hardly
to produce any audible effects from a telephone when the circuit
was simply opened and closed, caused very perceptible musical
sounds when the circuit was rapidly interrupted; and that the
higher the pitch of the sound the more audible was its effect. I
was much struck by the idea of producing sound in this way by
the action of light. Accordingly I proposed to pass a bright
light through one of the orifices in a perforated screen consisting
of a circular disk with holes near its circumference. Upon rapidly
rotating the disk an intermittent beam of light would fall on the
selenium, and from a connected telephone a musical tone would
be produced, its pitch depending upon the rapidity with which
the disk spun round.</p>

<h3>Variations of Light Necessary.</h3>

<p>&#8220;Upon further consideration I saw that the effect could not
only be produced at the extreme distance at which selenium would
normally respond to the action of a luminous
body, but that this distance could be indefinitely
increased by using a parallel beam of light, so
that we might telephone from one place to another
with no conducting wire between the transmitter and the
receiver. To reduce this idea to practice it was necessary to devise
an apparatus to be operated by the voice of a speaker, by which
variations could be produced in a parallel beam of light, corresponding
to variations in the air produced by the voice. I proposed,
therefore, to pass light through two plates perforated by
many small orifices. One of these plates was to be fixed, the
other was to be attached to the centre of a diaphragm actuated
by the voice. In its vibrations the diaphragm would cause the
movable plate to slide to and fro over the surface of the fixed
plate, by turns enlarging and contracting the free orifices for the
passage of light. The parallel beam emerging from this apparatus
could be received at some distant place on a lens focussing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
it upon a sensitive piece of selenium placed in a local circuit, with
a telephone and a galvanic battery. The variations in the light
produced by a speaker&#8217;s voice should cause corresponding variations
in the electrical resistance of the selenium at the distant
place, and the telephone in circuit with the selenium should
reproduce audibly the tones and articulations of the speaker&#8217;s
voice. It is greatly due to the genius and perseverance of my
friend, Mr. Sumner Tainter, that the problem thus entered upon
has been successfully solved.</p>

<h3>Special Treatment of the Selenium.</h3>

<p>&#8220;The first point to which we devoted our attention was reducing
the resistance of crystalline selenium within manageable limits.
The resistance of selenium cells, employed by
former experimenters, was counted in millions
of ohms; there is no record of a cell measuring
less than 250,000 ohms in the dark. We have
succeeded in producing cells measuring only 300 ohms in the
dark and 150 in the light. Our predecessors all seemed to have
used platinum for the conducting part of their cells, excepting
Werner Siemens, who found that iron and copper would do. We
have discovered that brass, although chemically acted upon by
selenium, forms an excellent material; indeed, we are inclined to
believe that the chemical action between brass and selenium has
contributed to the lowness in resistance of our cells, an intimate
union taking place between the two substances. In brass we
have constructed many cells of diverse forms. One of them
(two are described by Professor Bell), is cylindrical so that it
may be used with a concave reflector instead of with a lens. It is
composed of many metallic disks separated by mica disks slightly
smaller in diameter. The spaces between the brass disks over
the mica are filled with selenium, and the alternate brass disks are
metallically connected. The selenium is applied to the cell duly
heated: next comes annealing. To effect this an oven is inserted
in a pot of linseed oil standing upon glass supports in another
similar pot of linseed oil. The whole is then heated to about
214&deg; C., and kept there for twenty-four hours, then allowed to
cool down during forty to sixty hours until the temperature of
ordinary air is reached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<h3>A Perfected Transmitter.</h3>

<p>&#8220;We have devised more than fifty forms of photophonic transmitters.
In one of them (several others are described by Professor
Bell), a beam of light passes through
a lens of variable focus formed of two sheets
of thin glass or mica containing between them
a transparent liquid or gas. When vocal vibrations
are communicated to this gas or liquid, they cause a vibratory
change in the convexity of the glass surfaces with a corresponding
change in the intensity of the light as it falls upon the
selenium. We have found the simplest apparatus to consist in a
plane mirror of flexible material,
such as silvered mica or microscope
glass, against the back of which the
speaker&#8217;s voice is directed.</p>

<div class="figc250" id="Fig233">
<img src="images/illo452.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="302" />
<p class="caption">Selenium cylinder with
reflector.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;A large number of trials of this
apparatus have been made with the
transmitting and receiving instruments
so far apart that sounds could
not be heard directly through the air.
In a recent experiment Mr. Tainter
operated the transmitting instrument,
placed on the top of the
Franklin School House in Washington,
D. C.; the receiver being arranged
in a window of my laboratory,
at a distance of 213 metres. Upon placing the telephone to
my ear, I heard distinctly from the illuminated receiver: &#8216;Mr.
Bell, if you hear what I say, come to the window and wave your
hat.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have found that articulate speech can be reproduced by
the oxyhydrogen light, and even by a beam from a kerosene lamp.
The loudest effects follow upon interrupting the light by means
of a perforated disk swiftly rotated. Because this apparatus is
noiseless it allows a close approach of the receiver while not
interfering with its message.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have endeavored to ascertain the nature of the rays which
affect selenium, placing in the path of an intermittent beam
various absorbing substances. In these experiments Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
Cross has rendered us aid. When a solution of alum, or bisulphide
of carbon, is employed, there is but slight reduction in
loudness, but a solution of iodine in bisulphide of carbon cuts
off most of the audible effect. Even an opaque sheet of hard
rubber is less obstructive.</p>

<h3>Experiments Without a Telephone.</h3>

<p>&#8220;It is a well known fact that the molecular disturbance produced
in a mass of iron by the magnetizing influence of an intermittent
electrical current can be observed as
sound by placing the ear in close contact with
the iron. It occurred to us that the molecular
disturbance produced in crystalline selenium by
the action of an intermittent beam of light should be audible in a
similar manner with no telephone or battery. Many experiments
were made to verify this theory; at first without definite results.
The behavior of the hard rubber just mentioned suggested listening
to it also. This was tried with an extraordinary result. I
held the sheet in close contact with my ear while a beam of intermittent
light was focussed upon it through a lens. A distinct
musical note was immediately heard. Other substances, as enumerated
at the outset of my address, were now successively tried
in the form of thin disks, in every case with success. On the
whole, we feel warranted in announcing as our conclusion that
sounds can be produced by the action of a variable light from substances
of all kinds in the form of thin diaphragms. The reason
why thin diaphragms are more effective than masses appears to
be that the molecular disturbance produced by light is chiefly a
surface action, and that the vibration has to be transmitted
through the mass of the substance in order to affect the ear. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
have led air, directly in contact with an illuminated surface, to
the ear by throwing the luminous beam upon the interior of a
tube. We have thus heard from interrupted sunlight very perceptible
musical tones through tubes of ordinary vulcanized rubber,
of brass, and of wood. These were all the materials at hand
in tubular form, and we have had no opportunity since of extending
the observations to other substances. A musical tone can be
heard by throwing the intermittent beam of light into the ear itself.
This experiment was at first unsuccessful on account of the
position in which the ear was held.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Bessemer&#8217;s Early Achievements.</h3>

<p class="chapstart">In 1855 Henry Bessemer began to change the face of the civilized
world as he perfected his process for steel-making. The
story of his struggles, defeats and eventual triumph is told in his
autobiography published in London by <i>Engineering</i>.<a name="FNanchor_35"
id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> From that
book the publishers have permitted the following
pages to be drawn. As a boy Henry Bessemer
had a strong mechanical turn, amusing
himself with a lathe at an age when lads usually
prefer marbles or tag. In his youth there was a clear promise
of inventive faculty, plainly inherited from his father, Anthony
Bessemer, and naturally pursuing the lines of paternal interests.
Mr. Bessemer, senior, manufactured type of particular durability;
this quality his son discovered due to additions of a little
tin and copper to the ordinary alloy. It was in this field of alloying
that young Bessemer took his next step as an inventor, foreshadowing
the tremendous feat he was in due time to accomplish.
He busied himself as an engraver of rollers for embossing paper;
in cutting their deeply incised lines there was a tendency in curves
to drag or blur the surface of the metal. After several unsuccessful
attempts he produced an alloy of tin and bismuth free from
this fault.</p>

Bedford St., Strand, London, 1905. 16 shillings.</p></div>

<p>Soon afterward Bessemer&#8217;s attention was directed to the bronze<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
powders sold at high prices to printers and decorators. These
powders were produced by hand in Germany by processes so
laborious as to make the cost enormous. Examining the material
with a powerful microscope Bessemer was convinced that he
could dispense with hand labor, and turn out a powder of equal
quality at nominal expense. His machinery for this purpose
proved a success and laid the foundation of his fortune; unpatented
and worked in secret for thirty-five years, it yielded him
a huge profit indispensable for the costly experiments he had ever
in hand. Naturally enough his fame as a man of ingenuity was
promptly noised abroad, and his talents were next invoked for
a much-needed improvement of sugar-cane milling. The moment
that Bessemer saw a cane-mill at work he placed his finger on
the chief cause of its wastefulness. He noticed that the cane was
squeezed between two rollers for only a second, a period so short
that the cane at once re-expanded and re-absorbed much juice.
He forthwith designed a press, on much the same principle as a
hydraulic press, which subjected the cane to severe pressure for
two and a half minutes, until every drop of juice had left the
fibres, almost doubling the output of the old machinery. For
success in this task Bessemer declares himself indebted to a golden
ignorance. He says: &#8220;I had an immense advantage over many
others dealing with the problem under consideration, inasmuch
as I had no fixed ideas derived from long-established practice
to control and bias my mind, and did not suffer from the too-general
belief that whatever is, is right. Hence I could, without
check or restraint, look the question steadily in the face, weigh
without prejudice or preconceived notions, all the pros and cons,
and strike out fearlessly in an absolutely new direction if thought
desirable.&#8221;</p>

<p>But in his case ignorance in one field was joined to knowledge
in many another field, and there he found weapons wherewith
to surmount an old difficulty at a quarter never assaulted before.
He continues: &#8220;The first bundle of canes I ever saw had not
arrived from Madeira a week before I had settled in my own
mind certain fundamental principles, which I believed must govern
all attempts to get practically the whole juice from the cane;
but, of course, there were many circumstances that rendered it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
necessary to modify first principles, having reference to cost of
construction, lightness for easy transit across country, freedom
from necessity for repairs, and the like.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Bessemer&#8217;s Steel Process.</h3>

<p>In the supreme effort of his life Bessemer once more held himself
a debtor to his ignorance, to the fact that his mind was unworn
by routine and ruttiness. Referring to
his attempt to make a cheap metal stronger
than cast iron for guns, he says: &#8220;My knowledge
of iron metallurgy was at that time very limited, and consisted
only of such facts as an engineer must necessarily observe
in the foundry or smith&#8217;s shop; but this was in one sense an advantage
to me, for I had nothing to unlearn. My mind was open
and free to receive any new impressions, without having to
struggle against the bias which a life-long practice of routine
cannot fail more or less to create.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now appears the genius of the man, showing that if his brain
was unoccupied by rules-of-thumb it was full to overflowing with
original and sound ideas. He goes on to say: &#8220;A little reflection,
assisted by a good deal of practical knowledge of copper
and its alloys, made me reject all these from the first, and look
to iron or some of its combinations, as the only material suitable
for heavy ordnance.&#8221; Of fascinating interest is the great inventor&#8217;s
story of how step by step he arrived at his final success.
After reciting his preliminary experiments, in an endeavor to
remove carbon from pig iron so as to make malleable iron and
steel, he says:</p>

<p>&#8220;On my return from the Ruelle gun-foundry I resumed my
experiments with the open-hearth furnace, when some pieces of
pig iron on one side of the bath attracted my attention by remaining
unmelted in the great heat of the furnace, and I turned
on a little more air through the fire-bridge with the intention of
increasing the combustion. On again opening the furnace door,
after an interval of half an hour, these two pieces of pig still
remained unfused. I then took an iron bar, with the intention
of pushing them into the bath, when I discovered that they were
merely shells of decarburized iron, showing that atmospheric air
alone was capable of wholly decarburizing grey pig iron, and converting
it into malleable iron without puddling or any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
manipulation. Thus a new direction was given to my thoughts,
and after due deliberation I became convinced that if air could
be brought into contact with a sufficiently extensive surface of
molten crude iron, it would rapidly convert it into malleable iron.
Without loss of time I had some fire-clay crucibles made with
dome-shaped perforated covers, and also with some fire-clay
blow-pipes, which I joined on to a three-foot length of one-inch
gas pipe, the opposite end of which was attached by a piece of
rubber tubing to a fixed blast pipe. This elastic connection permitted
of the blow pipe being easily introduced into and withdrawn
from the crucible which, in effect, formed a converter.
About ten pounds of molten grey pig iron half filled the crucible,
and thirty minutes&#8217; blowing was found to convert this metal into
soft malleable iron. Here at least one great fact was demonstrated,
namely, the absolute decarburization of molten crude iron
without any manipulation, <i>but not without fuel</i>, for had not a
very high temperature been kept up in the air furnace all the time
this quiet blowing for thirty minutes was going on, it would
have resulted in the solidification of the metal in the crucible long
before complete carburization had been effected. Hence arose the
all-important question: Can sufficient internal heat be produced
by the introduction of atmospheric air to retain the fluidity of the
metal until it is wholly carburized in a vessel not externally
heated? This I determined to try without delay, and I fitted up a
larger blast-cylinder in connection with a 20 horse-power engine
which I had daily at work. I also erected an ordinary founder&#8217;s
cupola, capable of melting half a ton of pig iron. Then came the
question of the best form and size for the experimental converter.
I had very few data to guide me in this, as the crucible
converter was hidden from view in the furnace during the blow.
I found, however, that slag was produced during the process,
and escaped through holes in the lid. Owing to this, I constructed
a very simple form of cylindrical converter, about four feet in
interior height, sufficiently tall and capacious, I believed, to prevent
anything but a few sparks and heated gases from escaping
through a central hole made in the flat top of the vessel for that
purpose. This converter had six horizontal tuy&egrave;res arranged
around the lower part of it; these were connected by six adjustable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
branch pipes, deriving their supply of air from an annular
rectangular chamber, extending around the converter.</p>

<p>&#8220;All being thus arranged, and a blast of 10 or 15 pounds&#8217; pressure
turned on, about seven hundred-weight of molten pig iron
was run into the hopper provided on one side of the converter
for that purpose. All went on quietly for about ten minutes;
sparks such as are commonly seen when tapping a cupola, accompanied
by hot gases, ascended through an opening on the top of
the converter, just as I had supposed would be the case. But
soon after a rapid change took place; in fact, the silicon had been
quietly consumed, and the oxygen, next uniting with the carbon,
sent up an ever-increasing stream of sparks and a voluminous
white flame. Then followed a succession of mild explosions,
throwing molten slags and splashes of metal high up into the air,
the apparatus becoming a veritable volcano in a state of active
eruption. No one could approach the converter to turn off the
blast, and some low, flat, zinc-covered roofs, close at hand, were
in danger of being set on fire by the shower of red-hot matter
falling on them. All this was a revelation to me, as I had in no
way anticipated such violent results. However, in ten minutes
more the eruption had ceased, the flame died down, and the process
was complete. On tapping the converter into a shallow pan
or ladle, and forming the metal into an ingot, it was found to be
wholly decarburized malleable iron. Such were the conditions
under which the first charge of pig iron was converted in a
vessel neither internally nor externally heated by fire.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p>The narrative continues with details of further masterly experiments
until the new process was turning out steels of excellent
quality, containing any desired fraction of carbon, at a cost
of but six to seven pounds sterling per ton as against fifty to
sixty pounds by the methods which Bessemer laid upon the shelf.
His predecessors had made forty to fifty pounds of steel at a
time in small crucibles, he made five tons in twenty minutes. In
his magnificent simplification Bessemer at a stroke dismissed a
long series of troublesome processes long believed to be as unavoidable
as winter&#8217;s cold. He did away with the smelting of
pig iron, the rolling, shearing and piling of bars, and the heating
furnace. From the beginning of the Bessemer manufacture to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
the present hour, its main output has been rails for railroads.
In this single service the debt due to Bessemer surpasses computation,
for his steel has as least six-fold the durability of the
iron it has replaced. A rail laid at Crewe Station in 1863, weighing
twenty pounds to the yard, was turned in 1866 and taken up in
1875; it was estimated that 72,000,000 tons had passed over it,
while the greatest wear of its tables was but .85 inch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<p>Bessemer did not at once enter upon success in the practical
application of his process. British pig iron, with which he dealt,
abounded in phosphorus, an element which he could not drive out,
and which made his steels faulty. It was only when, at length,
he obtained pure pig iron from Sweden that he was able to supply
the market with pure, soft malleable iron, and with steels of
various degrees of hardness. In a sequel, full of interest, he
sketches the shrewd means by which he secured a handsome
fortune from his great invention, for Bessemer had remarkable
business ability as well as inventive genius. His labors in steel-making
obliged him to neglect his devices in the plate-glass manufacture
which, despite their merit, were also neglected by the
producers of plate-glass. He remarks: &#8220;The simple fact is that
an invention must be nursed and tended as a mother nurses her
baby, or it inevitably perishes.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Bessemer&#8217;s Versatility.</h3>

<p>So far from finding it gainful to concentrate his mind on a
single problem, ignoring every other, Bessemer delighted in
pursuing a wide variety of experiments, especially
before his engrossing responsibilities in
the manufacture of steel. In glass-making he
introduced some notable improvements. He tells us: &#8220;In going
over a glass-works I had noticed what I, at the moment, thought
was a great oversight in the mode of proceeding. The materials
employed, namely, sand, lime and soda in ascertained quantities,
were laid in heaps upon the paved floor of the glasshouse, and
a laborer proceeded to shovel them into one large heap, turning
over the powdered materials, and mixing them together; a certain
quantity of oxide of manganese was added during the general
mixing operation, for the purpose of neutralizing the green color
given to glass by the small amount of oxide of iron contained
in the sand. The materials were then thrown into the large glass
pots, which were already red-hot inside the furnace. What appeared
to me to be wanting in this rough-and-ready operation
was a far more intimate blending of these dry materials. A grain
of sand lying by itself is infusible at the highest temperature
attainable in a glass pot, and the same may be said of a small
lump of lime; but both are soluble in alkali, if it be within their
reach. These dry powders do not make excursions in a glass pot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
and look about for each other, and if they lie separated the time
required for the whole to pass into a state of solution will greatly
depend on their mutual contact. In such matters I always reason
by analogy, and look for confirmation of my views to other manufactures
or processes with which I may happen to have become
more or less acquainted. I may here remark that I have always
adopted a different reading of the old proverb, &#8216;A little knowledge
is a dangerous thing&#8217;; this may indeed be true, if your
knowledge is equally small on all subjects; but I have found a
little knowledge on a great many different things of infinite service
to me. From my early youth I had a strong desire to know something
of any and all the varied manufactures to which I have
been able to gain access, and I have always felt a sort of annoyance
whenever any subject connected with manufacture was
mooted of which I knew absolutely nothing. The result of this
feeling, acting for a great many years on a powerful memory,
has been that I have really come to know this dangerous little
of a great many industrial processes. I have been led to say this
so as to illustrate my observations on the extreme slowness of the
fusion of glass by an analogy in the manufacture of gunpowder.
I have shown it impossible for the dry powdered materials employed
in the manufacture of glass to react chemically upon each
other when they are lying far apart. Now if I take the three
substances, charcoal, nitre and sulphur, of which gunpowder is
composed, and break them into small fragments, then shake them
loosely together, and put a pound or two of this mixture on a
stone floor and apply a match, the nitre will fizzle briskly, the
sulphur will burn fitfully or go out, and the charcoal will last
several minutes before it is consumed. If, instead of this crude
and imperfect mixture, we take the trouble to grind these ingredients
under edge-stones into a fine paste with water, and then
dry and granulate it, we have still the precise chemical elements to
deal with which we ignited on the stone floor; but they now exist in
such close and intimate contact as instantly to act upon each other,
and a ton or two of these otherwise slow-burning materials will
be converted into gas in the fraction of a second. The inference
was simple enough, namely, to grind together the materials required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
to form glass, and when the heat of the furnace arrives
at the point where decomposition takes place, the whole will pass
into the fluid state much more quickly, and will yield a much more
homogeneous glass than is obtained in the usual manner.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Improves the Drying of Oils.</h3>

<p>Bessemer one day paid a visit to the works of his friends,
Hayward and Company, London, manufacturers of paints and
varnishes. He was struck with the wastefulness
and imperfection of the time-honored
process of drying oils in an iron pot over an
open fire; a crude method always attended with danger, and not
seldom with a complete loss of the heated oil. As he walked
through the works there occurred to him a much better plan
which he at once embodied in a sketch. His ideas were put into
practice by his friends, to their lasting profit. Instead of a small
charge of two or three gallons heated over an open fire, he suggested
that fifty or sixty gallons should be run into a tank, in
the bottom of which was a pipe terminating in a large rose-head.
Connected with this pipe was a coil that could be heated to any
desired temperature, and air could be forced through this coil,
escaping through the rose-head into the oil. The exact degree of
heat required could be thus maintained, and the process completed
with certainty and safety, without waste, and, above all,
with no discoloration of the oil. This method, carried to a
further degree of oxidation, is the foundation of the vast linoleum
industry throughout the world.</p>

<h3>Alfred Nobel and His Explosives.</h3>

<p>It was in trying to make guns of a new strength that Sir Henry
Bessemer entered the path which enabled him to make steel at
little more cost than cast iron. It was in providing
guns with explosives of new power that
Alfred Nobel won both distinction and fortune.
As in the case of Sir Henry Bessemer, his gifts
have inured vastly more to the service of peace than of war.
It is estimated that during the Civil War, 1861-65, more explosives
were used in the United States by civil, railroad, mining
and quarrying engineers than in the field of battle. Chief of
these explosives was gunpowder; nitro-glycerine, though well
known, had then little or no acceptance, for good reasons. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
its defects were overcome is told by Mr. Henry de Mosenthal
in an article on Alfred Nobel, in the Nineteenth Century Magazine,
London, October, 1898. By the editor&#8217;s kind permission
that article is here freely drawn upon.</p>

<p>Nitro-glycerine, discovered by Sobrero in 1847, is made by
treating glycerine with a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids;
it is poisonous, very sensitive to a shock, and most dangerous to
handle. Being liquid it runs into the fissures of rock when
poured into a bore-hole, and requires to be carefully confined
that it may explode when ignited by means of a simple fuse.
Nobel tried to overcome these deficiencies, first by mixing the
liquid with gunpowder, and then by adding fluids which rendered
it non-explosive, so that it could be safely transported, the
added liquid being removed just before use; he also suggested
confining it in a tube having the shape of a bore-hole, and firing
it by means of a small gunpowder cartridge or primer. But all
this did not avail, and accidents occurred so frequently that the
use of the blasting oil was prohibited in Belgium, in Sweden,
and later on in England. A vessel carrying some cases shipped
from Hamburg and bound for Chili was blown up, and the event
caused such a sensation that it seemed as if the use of nitro-glycerine
would be prohibited the world over. In the meantime,
however, Nobel had solved the problem of its safe use, and at the
end of 1866 he had invented a compound, which he called dynamite,
made by mixing the nitro-glycerine oil with porous absorbing
material, thus converting it into a paste. Dynamite proved
on experiment to be comparatively insensitive to a shock or a
blow; it burnt when ignited, and could be properly exploded
only by means of a powerful detonator fixed to the end of the
fuse and inserted into the plastic explosive.</p>

<p>The invention of dynamite marks an epoch in the history of
civilization. In judging of the degrees of culture of a people,
we are guided to a great extent by the kind of roads and waterways
they have constructed, and by the facility with which they
have obtained metals and applied them to the arts. The Romans
constructed excellent roads on the level, but in the mountains
they could only make narrow and very steep paths. Canals and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
cuttings were made with great sacrifice and labor, and only where
the soil was soft. Thus Suetonius states that in order to make
a cutting about three miles long to drain the Lacus Fucinus, the
Emperor Claudius employed 30,000 men for eleven years. In
the sixteenth century road making and mining were scarcely more
advanced. It took 150 years, ending with 1685, to mine five miles
of gallery in the Hartz mountains. Although blasting with
gunpowder dates back to the seventeenth century, it did not come
into general use until about the middle of the eighteenth century,
at which time the total cubage mined in Great Britain amounted
to little more than of a large railway cutting at the present day.
The use of gunpowder gave a great impetus to mining and public
works, but it was only the introduction of railways, and the necessity
of laying the lines on easy gradients, which raised blasting
to a science. The introduction of dynamite, thrice as powerful as
gunpowder and much more reliable, entirely revolutionized that
science, and made it possible to execute the gigantic engineering
works of our time, and brought about that prodigious development
of the mining industry of the world which we have witnessed
since 1870.</p>

<h3>Nobel Profits by an Accident.</h3>

<p>Dynamite is combined with twenty-five per cent. of inert matter
as an absorbent; for this large proportion of unexploding
substance, Nobel sought an active substitute.
This, he thought, might be a substance which
would dissolve in nitro-glycerine so as to form
a homogenous paste. Now for a sagacious experiment
with a liquid brought to his hand by accident. Whilst
experimenting in search of such a material, he one day cut his
finger and sent out for some collodion to form an artificial skin
to protect the wound; having used a few drops for that purpose,
it occurred to him to pour the remainder into some nitro-glycerine,
and he thus discovered blasting glycerine, which he patented
in December, 1875. Collodion is made by dissolving a gun-cotton
in a volatile solvent, a mixture of ether and alcohol, and Nobel
suggested that the viscous substance thus obtained should be
mixed with the nitro-glycerine so as to form a jelly. On further
experiment the jelly was dispensed with, and blasting gelatine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
was made, as it is now, by warming the nitro-glycerine, and
adding about eight per cent. of a gun-cotton which was found
to be soluble in nitro-glycerine. The new explosive, half as
strong again as dynamite, was too violent to be applicable to any
but the hardest rock. Nobel, however, discovered how to moderate
its action, and gelatine dynamite and gelignite were manufactured
by the addition of saltpetre and wood-meal to a blasting
gelatine of less consistency than that employed without such admixture.
Blasting gelatine was used in large quantities in the
piercing of the St. Gothard tunnel, where the rock was so hard
that no satisfactory work could be done without it. Since then
the use of the gelatine explosives has increased more and more,
and in some countries they have entirely superseded dynamite.</p>

<h3>Nobel Invents Smokeless Powder.</h3>

<p>The smokeless powder which Nobel originated was based on
his discovery that by means of heated rollers he could incorporate
with nitro-glycerine a very high percentage
of that soluble nitro-cellulose, or gun
cotton, which his factories were using in the
manufacture of blasting gelatine. Blasting
gelatine altered by means of moderating substances, had been
tried in guns and had burst them. Nobel now found that if the
nitrated cotton was increased from eight to about fifty per cent.
he obtained a powder suitable for firearms. The progress in the
construction of weapons, and especially the introduction of quick-firing
guns, made it necessary to have smokeless powder, while
higher velocities demanding straighter paths for projectiles could
be attained with new arms resisting high pressure. Whilst in
quest of such a powder, Nobel perfected several methods for
regulating the pressure in guns, and modifying the recoil. It
was in the beginning of 1888 that he invented his well-known
smokeless powder, or ballistite. His discovery that the two most
powerful shattering explosives, nitro-glycerine and gun-cotton,
when mixed in about equal proportions, would form a slow burning
powder, a propulsive agent with pressures which would exceed
the resistance of modern weapons, caused astonishment in technical
circles. Nobel submitted his powder to the British Explosive
Committee, which found that instead of employing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
variety of gun-cotton which is soluble in nitro-glycerine with the
aid of heat, the insoluble kind could be used provided an assistant
solvent could be added; and that the manufacture could be carried
on at lower temperatures than those necessary in producing other
explosives. The powder thus obtained was cordite, and this they
recommended for adoption.</p>

<h3>Nobel, Bodily Weak, was Strong in Mind and Will.</h3>

<p>Physically weak, of nervous, high strung and exceptionally
sensitive disposition, Nobel was endowed with a strong will, unbounded
energy, and wonderful perseverance;
he feared no danger and never yielded to adversity.
Many would have succumbed under
the misfortunes which befell him, but the succession
of almost insurmountable difficulties, the explosion of his
factory, causing a general scare and dread of the deadly compound
he was making, the loss of his younger brother, to whom he was
devotedly attached, the consequent paralysis of his father, and his
mother&#8217;s grief and anxiety, could not deter him from pursuing his
aim. His temerity frequently verged on foolhardiness, as when
he was going to his father&#8217;s works one day at St. Petersburg, and
finding no boat to take him across the river, he swam to the opposite
bank of the Neva. The co-existence of impulsive daring
with sensitive timidity was a striking feature in his character. He
frequently demonstrated the value and safety of his explosives with
his own hands, although he was particularly susceptible to headaches
caused by bringing nitro-glycerine in contact with the skin;
these headaches affected him so violently that he was often obliged
to lie down on the ground in the mine or quarry in which he was
experimenting. On one occasion when some dynamite could not
be removed from a large cask he crept into it and dug the explosive
out with a knife. Many other incidents could be related
of the fearlessness he displayed when the success of his invention
depended entirely upon his demonstrations of its safety, which in
those days had not yet been thoroughly proved.</p>

<p>Nobel died in 1896, at the age of 63; after providing legacies to
relatives and friends he left about $12,000,000, its income to be
annually divided into fifths, each fifth to be awarded for the most
important discovery or improvement in chemistry, physics, physiology,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
or medicine, and for the work in literature highest in the
ideal sense. In distributing these prizes no considerations of
nationality prevail.</p>

<h3>Invention Organized.</h3>

<p>In these days of organization, the career of the inventor takes
on a new breadth. If his ideas are sound, poverty need be no bar
to his success. To-day a man of proved ability
who entertains an idea for a new machine, engine,
or process may choose among the great
firms or companies interested in the field he would enter. His
plans are then canvassed by competent critics; if his suggestions
harbor a fallacy it is pointed out; if his aims, though feasible,
would be unprofitable, they are left severely alone. Perhaps in
essence his schemes are good, but need modification; this is duly
supplied. Instead of working all alone in twilight or darkness,
the inventor now takes up experiment with the aid of carefully
chosen assistants, with amassed information as to what others have
done in the same path, both at home and abroad.</p>

<p>When an inventor is an Edison, as remarkable in executive
ability as in creative power, it is he who organizes, as a general,
the forces which test his ideas and perfect such of them as prove
sound. Let Edison imagine a new storage battery; forthwith he
enlists a corps of chemists and metallurgists, engineers and mechanics,
and keeps them busy attacking the difficulties of his quest
mechanical, chemical, electrical. What if his mathematics go no
further than arithmetic, are not masters of the calculus to be engaged
on moderate terms in every university town? His personal
command of the pencil falls far short of the facility of professional
draftsmen who, at reasonable salaries, will turn out plans
and elevations quickly and accurately. His staff, bound to him
by affection and pride as with hooks of steel, are the fingers of his
hands to win triumphs which neither he alone, nor his men by
themselves, could ever accomplish.</p>

<p>It has been solely by organized ability, unfaltering faith in
ultimate success, and massed capital, that the steam turbine has
become the rival of the steam engine of Watt. A vast sum, expended
during nine years, was required to perfect its delicate and
exacting mechanism. One day a young engineer saw it whirling
away at high speed; with the efficiency of the gas engine in mind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
he asked, &#8220;Why not drive a turbine by gas instead of by steam?&#8221;
He took his idea to a leading manufacturing concern; it was approved,
and now that young inventor is attacking the difficulties,
neither few nor small, which stand in the way of building
an effective gas turbine.</p>

<h3>Great Combinations Create New Opportunities.</h3>

<p>In these latter days new doors are opened to ingenuity by the
comprehensiveness of great industries, by the huge scale on which
they conduct their business. A country blacksmith
is served well enough by a hand-blown bellows;
at the Homestead Steel Works the blowing
machinery has been designed by the best
engineering talent in America. When the output of a trust, or
even of a single company, rises to scores of millions of dollars
every year, it is worth while to measure how far moisture in a
blast may do harm, and adopt the elaborate plans of Mr. James
Gayley for drying air before sending it into a furnace. Take an
example of how the United States Steel Company has planned
every detail betwixt mine and mill. Each lake carrier, of immense
size, has its hold so curved that automatic clam-shells lift
ten tons of ore at each descent, shoveler and shovel being dismissed.
Vessels and docks dovetail into one another. The car-lengths,
as a freight train stands on its track, correspond to the
distance between one steamer-hoist and the next. In like fashion
every link in the chain is devised to save every possible foot-pound
of energy, every dispensable moment of time. Capital, always
cheaper than labor, is expended with both hands, and in no
direction more liberally than in setting at work the inventor of
economical devices, and his twin brother, the organizer, who deals
with the whole industry as a single mechanism to be reduced to
the lowest working cost and the highest ultimate efficiency.</p>

<h3>Team-Work in Research and Invention.</h3>

<p>During 1904 the General Electric Company at Schenectady,
New York, perfected for the New York Central &amp; Hudson River
Railroad an electric locomotive such as will be
used for passenger service between New York
and Croton. That locomotive, far outvying
anything else that ever before moved on wheels,
was created by a council of locomotive builders, electricians, engineers,
and mechanics. Some of the plans which they adopted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
with success had failed in times past. Each motor was made part
and parcel of the axle it turns, a directness of construction which
had never before proved to be feasible. Usually an electric
motor has many magnetic poles; the motors in this locomotive
have each only two poles.</p>

<p>On much the same lines this Company is constantly experimenting
with a view to cheapen and improve electric lighting. Every
filament, every luminous rod or vapor, as newly devised, is tested
and modified by as acute a band of investigators as exist in the
world, with all the benefit of daily conference and mutual aid.</p>

<h3>Group Attack.</h3>

<p>In such fields as those of the cheapening of light and motive
power, the utilization of electricity, the production of metals, it
would seem that the day of the solitary researcher
or inventor is drawing to a close. To-day
the man of original ideas, of combining faculty,
of uncommon deftness, of rare visual accuracy, is mated
with his peers for a group attack on a many-sided problem where
each man&#8217;s resources will find their special play. In untiring labor
at the bench and lathe, at the muffle and the test tube, one experiment
follows another, all duly compared, judiciously varied and
advanced as indication may suggest. Thus the fences which extreme
specialization have set up are surmounted, each worker
supplements the deficiencies of his fellows, and all join hands to
take by assault a citadel that might forever defy single attack.</p>

<p class="chapstart">Some recent noteworthy advances of invention have been
due to co-operation by many workers, not however on such
lines of definite group attack as have just been remarked. Among
these advances may be chosen for rapid survey the applications of
compressed air, of plain and reinforced concrete, the economy
of power-production and of fuel for whatever purpose employed.
Let us begin with compressed air.</p>

<h3>Compressed Air. In Effect Cold Steam for Driving Hammers, Drills, and Picks.</h3>

<p>Hammers, drills, and picks, all working by percussion, are
among the most effective tools. They may be attached to a steam
piston, as are Nasmyth hammers and common
quarry drills, yielding a much cheaper product
than does hand labor. In many places where
it is not feasible to use steam in this direct and
most economical way, it is best to employ compressed
air which works much as steam does,
so that a motor or a drill with no change of build may be operated
by one or other motive power at will. Compressed air, unlike
steam, may be taken long distances without condensation; in tight
receivers it may be kept without any loss as long as we like, and
used in mines and tunnels where steam heat would be a nuisance,
or where electricity would be unsafe. Electrical drills and cutters,
moreover, are liable to have their insulation harmed by working
shocks, and by surrounding grit, sand or chips. In mines after a
blast of gunpowder, a direct current from the main pipe quickly
freshens the air; at all times the cool, pure breeze from the exhaust
pipe is a welcome aid to ventilation. Steam, one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
chief servants of industry, must be kept and used hot. When its
energy is used to compress air we have at command a substance
with all the working quality of steam, without having to keep it
warm. As it toils at common temperatures, we can imagine compressed
air to be, in effect, cold steam.</p>

</div>

<p>Of late years cutters driven by compressed air have been largely
adopted throughout the coal mines of the United States. A cutter
weighing ten pounds, with air at seventy-five pounds behind it,
strikes a blow 160 to 250 times a minute, beginning at the floor
and making as little slack as a hand pick intelligently wielded.
Other tools, in great diversity, actuated in the same way, ask only
skill in guidance instead of muscular drudgery. Air drills are
used in mines, wells, tunnels, and rock foundations; at will the
mechanism impels a hammer instead of a drill. Air riveters build
ships and bridges, as well as fasten together the comparatively
small plates of boilers and fire-boxes. With a little variation in
its form we have a tool which caulks boilers, tanks, and ships.
Air-hammers light and strong have revolutionized the art of cutting
and carving stone, the force of a stroke being regulated by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
touch. Pneumatic hammers are of two kinds: Valveless hammers
in which the piston is the hammer, opening and shutting the inlet
and exhaust parts; and valve hammers, in which there is a distinct
moving valve. Hammers without valves are always short of
stroke, and are chiefly used in caulking and chipping. Some of
them yield as many as 250 strokes per minute. Valve hammers
do not move at this high pace, rarely exceeding thirty-five strokes
per minute, but each stroke is comparatively long and forcible
for riveting and the like severe work. In the Keller hammer the
valve moves longitudinally with the hammer barrel and in the
same direction with the hammer piston, instead of in the opposite
direction as is usually the case. A blow, therefore, tends to seat
the valve all the more firmly, instead of jarring it off its seat. Another
result is that the tool works efficiently even when the valve
is loosened by much use. This hammer is manufactured by the
Philadelphia Pneumatic Tool Co., Philadelphia.</p>

<p>It is interesting to learn from Mr. W. L. Saunders, of New
York, how the air-tools just considered were introduced. He
says<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. McCoy is entitled to the credit of first applying pneumatic
tools to heavy work, such as chipping metals, caulking boilers,
cutting stone and so on. He was not, however, the originator of
the broad idea, as long before he perfected the tool for heavy
work it had been used as a dental plugger, a device working compressed<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
air in a cylinder so that a piston struck the end of a tamping
tool, used to insert gold into the cavities of teeth.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p>A rock drill, on occasion, may serve as a blacksmith&#8217;s hammer.
The drill, detached from its tripod, is fastened to a vertical support.
The ram, duly supplied with compressed air, is fixed in
position over the anvil, upon
which it descends more frequently
if less forcibly than
a steam hammer. A rock
drill may also serve to drive
drift bolts into the timbers
of caissons. This task when
effected by ordinary sledge
hammers is slow and costly,
while with compressed air
as a servant capital work is
done at much lower expense.
The drill is provided with
handles so as to be readily
managed by two men, who
place the anvil, with its
cupped end, on the head of
the bolt to be driven. Pneumatic
energy does the rest.</p>

<p>With dimensions much enlarged
an air-driven piston becomes a rammer for foundry sand,
for roads and pavements, for tamping the beds of railroads. In
foundries a moulder is furnished with a small sand-sifter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
vibrated by compressed air; he is now free to use his shovel all
the time, so that he does five times as much work as before.
Hoists small and large are actuated by the same agency; in every
case the mechanism is so simple that
rough usage is withstood and repairs,
when needed, are easily effected. If a
ratchet, a pawl, a bearing, wears out, a
new one can be bought at small cost and
at once fitted into place. Designers have
produced rotary as well as reciprocating
air tools; of these a wood-borer is a
capital example.</p>

<img src="images/illo479.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="409" />
<p class="caption">Water lifted by

</div>

<p>Sometimes it is well worth while to employ
compressed air simply as a blast to
keep a milling-cutter free from its chips;
when the blast is cold, as it usually is, the
cutter may turn all the quicker.</p>

<p>Compressed air can do much else than
impel pistons of familiar type. In one remarkable
device it has put pistons out of
business altogether.</p>

<h3>Air-Lifts.</h3>

<p>Fill a tumbler to the brim with water,
take a straw and dip it to the bottom of
the glass, blowing as heartily as you can.
At once the water overflows because displaced
by rising bubbles of air. Instead of a tumbler take a long
upright pipe filled with water, send to its base compressed air of
adequate pressure, and you have the Pohle air-lift,
which carries water into the reservoirs of
Fort Madison, Iowa, of Dixon, Illinois, of Asbury
Park, New Jersey, and many other towns and villages. On
a smaller scale the air-lift brings up water from thousands of
wells, rivers, and lakes. Aboard ship it moves water ballast from
one compartment to another, so as to give the vessel just the
trim or inclination desired. In chemical works it raises liquids
so corrosive that no other lifter is feasible. It has no valves or
other moving parts to be deranged or hurt in case its stream bears
sand or dirt, so that it is a capital drainage pump; after serving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
thus it may bring sewage to farms and distribute it thoroughly.
To be fairly efficient the air-lift requires that two thirds of the
length of its upright pipe be immersed below the surface of the
liquid to be raised.</p>

<h3>Liquids Lifted by Expanding Air.</h3>

<p>For oil wells, which may be 2000 or more feet in depth, a
lifter not so simple is employed. A pipe, comparatively large, is
lowered to the oil. Its base forms a receiver
which, at will, may be closed on its earthward
side, then through a small inner tube compressed
air reaches the oil to force it bodily to
the surface of the ground. The Harris pump lifts oil, water, or
other liquids with high efficiency: it allows the compressed air
after use to act expansively;
this helps to drive the compressor;
then this expanded
air is once more highly compressed,
and so recurrently.</p>

<p class="caption">Harris system of pumping by compressed
air, showing switch. Pneumatic
Engineering Co., New York.</p>
</div>

<h3>A Jack-of-All-Trades.</h3>

<p>Compressed air readily
moves liquids as masses; it
as easily impels them as particles.
A lady&#8217;s toilet table
usually displays an atomizer.
Its rubber bulb, sharply
squeezed, emits a tiny
stream of perfume as a
quick air blast breaks a
drop of liquid into spray.
Magnify this apparatus and
you have a painting machine
for freight and passenger
cars, fences, and out-buildings.
Driven as it is with
projectile force the pigment
penetrates further than if
laid on by hand, reaching
crannies and crevices which evade a brush. On the same principle
Hook&#8217;s spraying machine sends Bordeaux mixture into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
foliage of an orchard, or delivers a solution of carbolic acid upon
the floors, walls, and ceilings of a hospital or a sick-room.
Strengthen such a blast and you can elevate,
dry, and aerate grain, or lift the culm from a
coal heap to a furnace, and then discharge the
ashes as they tumble from a grate. Where stretches of water
are sandy and muddy, compressed air dredges a channel by stirring up
deposits at the bottom.</p>

<h3>Removing Dust and Dirt.</h3>

<p>An air compressor reversed in direction is an air exhauster,
such as we find carrying money in department stores. The
powerful in-draft of this apparatus, often
drawing large pieces of paper or card into the
pipes, has led to the invention of a means of
removing dust and dirt, admirable in thoroughness.
A receiver, shaped to suit its special task, is passed over
pictures and their frames, upholstery, carpets or bare floors, and
through the flexible pipe
attached to its handle, dust
and dirt are borne into a
reservoir where they are
caught by water for due
removal. Ordinary sweeping
with a broom, the usual
wielding of a feather
duster, or a blast of compressed
air, but stir up dust
and dirt for harmful redistribution. This &#8220;vacuum&#8221; cleaning
method takes dust and dirt wholly away, and with wonderful
celerity. See <a href="#Fig158">picture</a> opposite page 164. It is astonishing to see a
pound of fine flour removed from a thick carpet in twelve seconds,
leaving behind not one visible particle. This plan cleanses carpets
without their being lifted from floors, or a billiard cloth just as it
stands on a table. This service greatly promotes health; the
further the physician goes with his microscope the more convinced
is he that dust is one of the chief carriers of disease.</p>

gale.</p>

<h3>Sand-blast.</h3>

<p>In Lyell&#8217;s Bay, near Wellington, New Zealand, and in many
other places throughout the world, flints have been found so
beautifully and symmetrically polished that
they were at first believed to be products of
art, yet nothing but wind-blown sand had
given them form. Fifty years ago globes for gas jets were frosted
by a handful of sand quickly thrown from side to side for a few
minutes. Strange to
say, gunnery was to
supply the link to
carry sand to labors
of much greater
moment.</p>

<img src="images/illo482.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="205" />
<p class="caption">Vacuum renovators for carpets and upholstery.</p>
</div>

<p>General B. C.
Tilghman, of Philadelphia,
one day
noticed the much
worn touch-hole of an
old bronze cannon. He felt sure that the wear had been due not
so much to outflowing gases as to bits of unburnt powder driven
out at each discharge, identifying this abrasion with the roughening
of glass in windows facing sandy shores of the sea. In 1870
he began experiments by blowing sand jets with a fan, soon discovering
that he had hit upon a cheap and easy means of frosting
glass, carving stone, and scouring castings. He was astonished
to find that sand readily pierced materials harder than itself, as
corundum and toughened steel. To-day the sand-blast executes
many new tasks: it resurfaces stone buildings which have become
discolored and grimy; it cleanses metallic surfaces for the welder,
the electroplater, the enameler; it renews files and rasps; it removes
scale from boilers, paint and rust from steel bridges and
other structures. The apparatus manufactured by Mr. C. Drucklieb,
of New York, designed much in the form of a steam injector,
employs air at a pressure of about twenty pounds to the square
inch.</p>

<h3>Air Compressors.</h3>

<p>Compressed air is at work on so large a scale that its economical
production and use are matters of consequence. Mechanism for
both purposes, of the best design, involves a few simple principles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
Suppose we have a cylinder, fourteen inches long, and
that with a piston we force the contained air within one inch of
its base, so as to occupy <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>14</sub> of its original
volume. This act of compression, which we
will imagine to be all but instantaneous, will
heat the air through 613&deg; Fahr., so that if at 60&deg; when the operation
begins, the air will be 673&deg; at the end. Suppose, further, that
this air parts with no heat to surrounding
metal, and that the piston
moves without friction; the compressed
air on being allowed to expand
will return all the work expended
in compression, and resume
its first temperature, 60&deg;. If air
would serve us in this ideal way,
we would have an agent with all
the good points of steam and none
of its drawbacks. In actual practice
several items left out of our
imaginary picture must be reckoned
with. Air heated in compression
quickly warms surrounding masses
and has to be cooled when sent off
on distant errands, losing much
working power in the process. The
very act of compression retards itself:
the air, because heated, has
additional elasticity for the compressor
to overcome.</p>

<div class="figc300" id="Fig247">
<img src="images/illo483.png" alt="" width="300" height="560" />
<p class="caption">Injector sand-blast.<br />
C. Drucklieb, New York.</p>
</div>

<p>Plainly, the engineer should begin by sending into his compressor
air as cool as possible, and during compression he should
keep the temperature of the air as low as he can. Moderate pressures,
to fifty pounds per square inch or so, may well be effected
at a single stroke, the air as it issues from the compressing cylinder
passing through pipes immersed in cold water, a similar
chilling stream being sent around the cylinder walls themselves.
This air at fifty pounds, duly cooled, may now, if we wish, be
brought to say 100 pounds pressure in a second cylinder; its output<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
is in turn cooled as before by conveyance through pipes
bathed in cold water. The more thorough the cooling, the less
moisture will the air contain to give trouble afterward by condensing
in pipes or machinery. If a pressure higher than 100
pounds to the square inch is
in request, a third compressor
may be linked to the
second. In some installations,
where extreme pressures
are attained, four-fold
apparatus is employed; its
chief economy rests in cooling
the air at four distinct
stages, greatly diminishing
the work which otherwise
would have to be wastefully
done.</p>

<p>With the energy of steam
economically converted into
the energy of compressed
air, the engineer sends his
new servant as far as he
pleases. Let us imagine that
a mile off he wishes to drive
a gang of saws. He will
soon notice that the exhaust
pipe is very cold, and if the
compressed air was not well dried as produced, its moisture will
now be deposited not as water merely, but as frost to check the
machinery. This is because air, like steam, falls in temperature
as it expands at work; that fall measuring the heat-equivalent
of the work performed. For the chill which the engineer observes,
he has a simple remedy; he surrounds the air pipe, as it
enters its machinery, with a small heater, fed with coke, coal, or
oil. At once all frost vanishes, and the air with added elasticity
is vastly more effective than before. By no other means can so
much work be won from fuel as through this device. In some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
cases a heater has yielded 1.25 horse power for an hour in return
for each pound of coal it has burned.</p>

<p>In producing compressed air, inventors step by step have kept
in view the best steam practice. It was long ago observed that
working steam when wholly expanded in one cylinder chills itself,
imparting its chill to the cylinder walls so that they seriously cool
the next charge of steam, lowering its value for motive power.
In a multiple expansion engine of four successive cylinders, each
in turn receives the steam, which with thorough jacketing is maintained
at the highest temperature possible. Keeping to converse
lines the compressor divides its task into stages, at each of which
a desired change of temperature can be easily effected. With
steam this change consists in adding heat; with compressed air it
consists in abstracting heat.</p>

<h3>A Centralized Air Plant.</h3>

<p>Thirty miles from Cleveland, at North Amherst, Ohio, is the
largest sandstone quarry in the world. Its owners, the Cleveland
Stone Company, in their original plant employed
steam from no fewer than forty-nine
boilers, all machinery, including drills and
channelers, being driven by steam. In January, 1904, this was
replaced by a centralized air plant which has resulted in marked
economy. In the power-house four water-tube boilers, each of 257
horse-power rated capacity, drive compound compressors which
deliver air at about 100 pounds pressure. This air, duly piped, is
distributed to drills, channelers, hoists, pumps, saws, grindstones,
forge fires, and so on. Economies, familiar in electrical centralization,
are here paralleled in an interesting way. In the working
day not a moment is wasted. When the whistle blows the full
working pressure is ready to begin work and maintain duty until
night. There is no fluctuation of pressure due to careless boiler
attendance; no wheeling coal or water barrels to keep pace with
advancing channelers. Some of the old boilers, discarded from
steam service, are used as air receivers, these and other reservoirs,
together with the pipe line itself, unite their immense storage
capacity so that throughout the day there is no peak load. Incidentally
the new plant renders the quarry free from smoke-laden
steam such as of old darkened its air and soiled its output. Fuel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
and labor under this system were reduced one half when a month
of the old service was compared with a month of the new. In
one case steam is used for power outside of the main plant. Close
to the power-house is a mill where eleven gang saws are driven
by a steam engine of 175 horse-power. The nearness of this engine
to the boilers ensures a somewhat higher economy than if
compressed air were employed. Here, as everywhere else, the
engineer engages whatever servant will do good work at the
lowest wages.</p>

<h3>Westinghouse Air Brakes and Signals.</h3>

<p>By all odds the most important use of compressed air is that
developed by Mr. George Westinghouse, of Pittsburg, in his automatic
brakes for railroads. For each locomotive
he provides an air compressor which
fills in the engine itself, and beneath each car, a
reservoir of compressed air. Every reservoir
aboard a long train in rapid motion may at the same instant, by a
touch from the engine-runner, actuate the brakes so as to stop
the train in the shortest possible time. This invention has accomplished
more for the safety of quick railroad travel than any other
device; no wonder, then, that Westinghouse brakes are in all but
universal use. They are now being adopted for trolley-cars which
often require to be stopped in the briefest possible period. The
Westinghouse Company builds and installs elaborate signal systems
worked by compressed air and electricity. All these are described
and pictured in the &#8220;Air Brake Catechism,&#8221; by Robert H.
Blackall, published by N. W. Henley &amp; Co., New York. This
book is constantly appearing in new editions, of which the reader
should procure the latest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX<br />
CONCRETE AND ITS REINFORCEMENT</h2>

<p class="chaptoc">Pouring and ramming are easier and cheaper than cutting and carving .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Concrete for dwellings ensures comfort and safety from fire .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Strengthened with steel it builds warehouses, factories and bridges of
new excellence.</p>

<p class="chapstart">Stone and wood in the builder&#8217;s hands require skill and
severe labor for their shaping; vastly simpler and easier is
the task of molding a wall from wet clay, or other semi-plastic
material. It was long ago discovered that certain mixtures of
clay and sand, duly mingled and burned, became as hard as stone.
To this discovery we owe, among other arts, that of brick-making.
In joining brick to brick, or stone to stone, a mortar of uncommon
strength was used by the Romans. All by itself, when laid a little
at a time, it formed a strong and lasting structure. Then it occurred
to some inventive builder, Why not save mortar by throwing
into it gravel and bits of broken stone? He accordingly
reared a wall of what we should now call rude concrete, whose
lineal descendant to-day is a semi-plastic mass of Portland
cement, sand, and gravel or broken stone, together with the necessary
water. Its use allows the ease and freedom of pouring, while
affording structures with all the strength of stone or brick.</p>

<p>For much of the early work lime and sand were mixed to make
a mortar of the usual kind, in which stone or gravel was embedded.
Afterward it was found that volcanic ashes, such as
those of Puzzuoli near Naples, formed with lime a compound
which resisted water and was therefore suitable for structures
exposed to damp or wet. In the middle ages concrete was employed
throughout Europe, after the Roman fashion, for both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
foundations and walls. In walls it was usually laid as a core
faced with stone masonry, large stones often being embedded in
the mass. About 1750, while building the third Eddystone Lighthouse,
John Smeaton discovered that a limestone which contained
clay, when duly burnt, cooled, ground, and wetted, hardened
under water, was indeed a natural cement, by which name it
is still known. Deposits suitable for the direct manufacture of
natural cement were in 1818 discovered in Madison and Onondaga
Counties, New York, by Canvass White, an engineer who
used this cement largely in building the Erie Canal. Natural
cement has a powerful rival in Portland cement, due to Joseph
Aspdin, of Leeds, who in 1824 mixed slaked lime and clay, highly
calcined. The resulting clinker when ground, and only when
ground, unites with water, the strength of the union increasing
with the fineness of the grinding. Because this product looks
like Portland stone, much used in England, it was given the
name of Portland cement. The raw materials suitable for making
it are widely distributed throughout North America, much more
widely than those from which natural cement may be had. This
is the principal reason why Portland cement is now produced in
the United States in about six-fold the quantity of natural cement.</p>

<p>So rapidly has concrete grown in public favor with American
builders that in 1905 they used seven-fold as much as in 1890.
It has been widely adopted for pavements, as at Bellefontaine,
Ohio; for breakwaters, as at Galveston and Chicago; for tunnels,
as in more than four miles of the New York Subway. The
foundations beneath the power-house of the Interborough Rapid
Transit Company, New York, required 80,000 cubic yards; for
the new station of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, New
York, a much greater quantity is being employed; in their turn
these figures will be far exceeded by the needs of the new Croton
Dam for the water supply of New York, and the Wachusett
Dam for the water supply of Boston.</p>

</div>

<p>Concrete has long been adopted for a variety of less ambitious
purposes. At St. Denis, near Paris, it was many years ago
molded into a bridge of modest span. It has formed thousands
of dwellings in factory and mining villages and towns, as well as
many villas of handsome design. It is particularly well adapted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
for silos, as here <a href="#Fig249">illustrated</a>.<a name="FNanchor_36"
id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> All this expansion of an old art
has been stimulated by a steady reduction in the price of Portland
cement, and by constant improvement in its quality. As the
manufacture has expanded, its standards have risen, its machinery
has become more economical and trustworthy in results.
While the cost of concrete has thus been lowered by a fall in the
price of cement, the wages of bricklayers and stone-masons have
advanced, adding a new reason for building in concrete, since it
requires in execution but little skilled labor. The good points of
concrete are manifold; it forms a strong, fire-resisting, and damp-proof
structure. For mills and factories another item of gain is
that it forms a unit such as might be hewn out of a single huge
rock, vibrating machinery therefore affects it much less than it
does an ordinary building. At the same time its walls and floors
obstruct sound, conducing to quiet. Concrete must be honestly
made and used, otherwise, just as in the case of rubbishy bricks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
ill laid, it may tumble down from its own weight. And furthermore
it is necessary to recognize how widely concretes of diverse
composition vary in strength and durability. There should be a
careful adaptation in each case of quality to requirement. Concrete
walls, as first produced, had a forbidding ugliness; this is
being remedied by surfacings of pleasant neutral tones. A well
designed residence executed in concrete at Fort Thomas, Kentucky,
is shown opposite this page.</p>

<p>In Mr. Edison&#8217;s judgment a vast field awaits the concrete industry
in building small, cheap dwellings. He once said to me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
as he spoke of his cement mill,&mdash;&#8220;What I want to see is an architect
of the stamp of Mr. Stanford White of New York take up
this material. Let him design half a dozen good dwellings for
working people, all different. Each set of molds, executed in
metal, would cost perhaps $20,000. Such dwellings could be
poured in three hours, and be dry enough for occupancy in ten
days. A decent house of six rooms, as far as the shell would go,
might cost only three hundred dollars or so. It would be stereotypy
over again and the expense for the models would disappear
in the duplications repeated all over the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Concrete is now supplied to builders in blocks, usually hollow
and much larger than bricks. When cast in sand they look like
stone. Of course, subjected as they are to more than ordinary
stresses, their production demands special care. The methods,
therefore, which are adopted in manufacturing these blocks may
be taken as the best practice in the industry broadly considered.
Says Mr. H. H. Rice, of Denver<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>&#8220;The sand employed should
be sharp, silicious and clean. The gravel used should contain a
fair proportion of as large sizes as can be advantageously employed
in the particular machine used. Where gravel is not
available, crushed stone takes its place. Care should be exercised
to obtain stone as strong as the mortar. What proportions of
sand, gravel and broken stone should be mixed together is a
question determined by the extent of their voids: these may vary
from one third to one half the whole volume. Assuming that
we have to deal with the larger fraction, a mixture of 1 cement,
2 sand, 4 gravel, should be employed; this is classified as the
lowest grade of fat mixture. At times a lean mixture, 1 cement,
3 sand, 5 gravel, might be advantageously adopted. Where
gravel or broken stone is not used, the proportion of cement to
sand should be as 1 to 4. A fat mixture has greater tensile
strength than a lean mixture, but resistance to compression depends
upon a thorough filling of voids. A lean mixture thoroughly
worked, proves more satisfactory than a fat mixture with
hasty and indifferent handling. With any mixture success is attained
only by completely coating every grain of sand with
cement, and every piece of stone or gravel with the sand-cement
mortar. (See Mr. Umstead&#8217;s results, <a href="#Page_240">page 240</a>.)</p>

</div>

<p>In producing concrete blocks there are three different
methods, tamping, pressing, and pouring, each adapted to a particular
mixture for a special kind of work. Two-piece walls, devised
in 1902, deserve a word of description. The pressed blocks
of which they are built show the new freedom conferred by concrete
as a building material. Each block has a long right-angle
arm extending inward from the middle, and a short arm extending
from each end. In laying the blocks in a wall no portion of a
block extends through the wall. By leaving the exterior vertical
joints open to afford a free circulation of air, no part of a block
on one side of the wall touches any block from the opposite side;
this prevents the passage of moisture and produces in effect two
walls, tied by the overlapping arms or webs in alternate courses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
and affording in its bond a great resistance to lateral stresses.
Blocks in other forms equally useful are steadily gaining
popularity.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Concrete, although widely available to the builder, is in many
cases a material he cannot employ. For a store-house, thickness
of wall, ensuring an equable temperature, is an advantage; for
an office-building, reared on costly ground, this thickness is out
of the question. Beams, too, cannot have much length in a
material which is only one tenth as strong in tensile as in compressive
resistance. Clearly the scope for concrete by itself was
to be limited unless it could find a partner able to confer strength
while adding but slight bulk. An experiment of the simplest was
to be the turning point in a great industry.</p>

<h3>Concrete Reinforced by a Backbone of Steel. Joseph Monier, the Pioneer.</h3>

<p>Concrete, as one of its minor uses, had often been molded into
tubs for young trees and shrubs. In 1867, Joseph Monier, a
French gardener, in using tubs of this kind
found them heavy and clumsy. By way of
improvement he built others in which he embedded
iron rods vertically in the concrete,
securing thus a strong frame-work which permitted
him to use but little concrete, and make
tubs comparatively light and thin. Monier was not a man to rest
satisfied with a single step in a path of so much promise. Before
his day builders had joined concrete and metal, but without recognizing
the immense value of the alliance. He proceeded to
build tanks, ponds, and floors of his united materials, at length
rearing bridges of modest proportions. His work attracted attention
in Germany and Austria, as well as at home in France,
so that soon reinforced concrete, as it was called, became a serious
rival to brick and stone. For two thousand years and more, concrete
had been a familiar resource of the builder; to-day with a
backbone of steel it fills an important place between masonry and
skeleton steel construction, boldly invading the territory of both.</p>

<h3>Disposal of Steel in Reinforced Concrete.</h3>

<p>Reinforced concrete has been thoroughly studied with regard
to its properties and the forms in which it may be best disposed.
Since the strength of concrete is usually ten-fold
greater in compression than in tension,
designs should be compressive whenever possible,
all tensile strains being carefully committed
to the steel. In arched bridges the
strains are chiefly compressive, hence the success with which they
are executed in reinforced concrete. Mr. Edwin Thacher of New
York, eminent in this branch of engineering, sees no reason why
spans of 500 feet should not be feasible and safe. Some remarkable
discoveries have followed upon experiments with reinforcement
diverse in form and variously placed within a mass. To
increase the strength of a square steel bar Mr. E. L. Ransome
twists it into spiral form; on square steel bars Mr. A. L. Johnson
places projections; Mr. Edwin Thacher rolls his steel into sections
alternately flat and round. All these contours have large
surfaces at which metal and concrete adhere. Reinforcing bars
designed by Mr. Julius Kahn and by the Hennibique Construction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
Company are smooth, and slightly bent from straightness at
intervals. In every case the question is, Where will the tensile
strength of the steel do most good, because most needed? M.
Considere has found that concrete hooped with steel wire has
more than twice the resistance of concrete in which an equal
amount of steel is centrally placed. In his floor constructions M.
Matrai gives steel wires the
curves they would take under a
load. Keeping to its original
lines the Monier reinforcement of
to-day consists in a rectangular
netting of rods or wires. Somewhat
similar is the expanded
metal backing invented by Mr. J.
F. Golding; it is sheet steel pierced
with parallel rows of slits which
are expanded until the metal assumes
the form shown in an accompanying
illustration. A lock
woven-wire fabric of galvanized
steel wire is made by W. N. Wight &amp; Company, New York, in
any desired size of mesh, with an ultimate strength of 116,000
pounds per square inch of metal.</p>

of moisture, its exemption from the ravages of the
teredo, render it much preferable to timber for marine work.</p>

<h3>Molds for Reinforced Concrete.</h3>

<p>Reinforced concrete, like every other new building material,
has called forth ingenuity in many ways. When,
for instance, a factory is to be reared much inventive
carpentry is required
to plan and construct the
forms, or molds, into which
the liquid concrete is to be
poured around the steel skeletons. The footings,
outside and inside columns, walls, girders,
beams, floor-plates, roofs, and stairs all require
separate forms, intelligently devised with a view
to economy. For the Ingalls Building, Cincinnati,
the forms cost $5.85 per cubic yard of concrete
in place. White pine is the best wood for
the purpose; it is readily worked and keeps its
shape when exposed to wind and weather. For
common buildings a cheaper wood, spruce or fir,
may be chosen; even hemlock will serve if a rough finish suffices.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
In most cases green lumber is preferable to dry as less affected by
water in the concrete. In fine work the boards of which the
molds are made are oiled, and may
be used over and over again. In all
tasks a strict rule is that the reinforcing
metal be properly placed
and remain undisturbed as work
proceeds.</p>

<h3>Buildings of Reinforced Concrete.</h3>

<p>The Pugh Power Building,
erected for manufacturing purposes
in Cincinnati, is a capital example of
what can be done with reinforced
concrete. It is 68 feet wide, 335
long, and 159 high; its columns are
spaced fourteen to seventeen feet
longitudinally, twenty to twenty-three
feet transversely; the floors are
figured to bear a load of 230 pounds per square foot. In the same
city is the Ingalls Building, for offices, 100 by 50 feet, and 210
feet high, designed by Mr. E. L. Ransome of
New York. Among other structures of his
design, executed in the same material, is the
St. James Episcopal Church, Brooklyn, New
York; buildings for the United Shoe Machinery Company,
Beverly, Massachusetts, and piano factories for the Foster-Armstrong
Company, Despatch, New York. The inspection shops of
the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, West 59th Street,
New York, are also of reinforced concrete: no wood is used in
wall or roof.</p>

<p>Reinforced concrete forms nine bins in one of the grain
elevators of the Canadian Pacific Railway at Port Arthur, Ontario,
on the shore of Lake Superior. The walls are nine inches
thick, reinforced horizontally and vertically to a height of ninety
feet and a diameter of thirty feet. There are also four intermediate
bins, the whole thirteen holding 443,000 bushels. At
South Chicago the Illinois Steel Company has built four similar
bins for the storage of cement, each twenty-five feet in diameter
and fifty feet high, with walls five to seven inches thick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>

<p>Many chimneys have been built of the new material; notably
the chimney for the Pacific Coast Borax Company, Bayonne,
New Jersey, 150 feet high, with an
interior diameter of seven feet. These
dimensions are exceeded at Los Angeles,
California, where a chimney for
the Pacific Electric Company rises 174
feet above its foundations, with an inside
diameter of eleven feet. Both
structures have hollow walls of the
Ransome type reinforced horizontally
and vertically.</p>

<p>That reinforced concrete serves to
build chimneys and flues is proof of
its fire-resisting quality. Concrete is
a slow conductor of heat, and both it
and steel have almost the same slight
expansibility as temperatures rise, so
that they remain together in a fire.
Terra cotta, which expands much
more than steel when heated, cracks
off from the metal it was intended to
protect, leaving it to bend or fuse in
a blaze. Concrete, furthermore, behaves
well when its temperature is
suddenly lowered, as when a fireman
dashes a stream of water upon it at a
fire. No wonder, then, that the reinforced
concrete is more and more in
request in cities as the material for
buildings rising higher and standing
more thickly on the ground than did
buildings of old. In the great fire in
San Francisco, April, 1906, reinforced concrete withstood extreme
temperatures much better than any other material. It will
be largely used in rebuilding the city.</p>

<h3>Resistance to Fire and Rust.</h3>

<p>Frequently the question is asked, Is the steel in reinforced concrete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
liable to corrosion, so that its walls are likely to become weak
and insecure after a few years? With careful planning and faithful
workmanship the results prove to be worthy of confidence.
Professor Charles L. Norton of Boston has
taken steel, clean and in all stages of corrosion,
and embedded it in stone and cinder
concrete, wet and dry mixtures, in carbon dioxide and sulphurous
gases; other specimens were intermittently exposed
to steam, hot water, and moist air
for one to three months. Duly protected
by an inch or more of sound
concrete the steel was absolutely
unchanged while naked steel vanished
into streaks of rust. Mr. Ransome
says that in tearing up a
stretch of sidewalk in Bowling
Green Park, New York, in use
twenty years, some embedded steel
rods were found in perfect condition.
The Turner Construction Company,
of New York, exposed concrete
blocks in which steel bars were embedded, and laid them on a
beach at low tide where they were covered by salt water three
or four hours every day; after nine months&#8217; exposure the blocks
were broken disclosing the bars free from rust. Professor
Spencer B. Newberry records that a water main at Grenoble,
France, built on the Monier system, twelve inches in diameter,
eighteen inches thick, containing a framework of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> and <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>
inch steel rods, was found perfectly free from rust after fifteen
years&#8217; service in damp ground. He also states that a retaining
wall of reinforced concrete in Berlin was examined after eleven
years&#8217; use and the metal found uncorroded, except in some cases
where the rods were only 0.3 or 0.4 inch from the surface.</p>

<h3>Tanks, Standpipes, Reservoirs.</h3>

<p>This waterproof quality of reinforced concrete recommends it
as a material for tanks and reservoirs. In 1903 a water tower
was built at Fort Revere, Massachusetts, for the United States
Government, ninety-three feet in height, octagonal in section, enclosing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
a tank twenty feet wide, fifty feet high, with walls six
inches thick at the bottom, three at the top, coated inside with an
inch of Portland cement. At Louisville, Kentucky, a reservoir
has been built 394 by 460 feet, and about
twenty-five feet high. Its walls and columns
are concrete, its roof is in reinforced concrete
disposed as groined arches, each of nineteen
feet clear span. A reservoir wholly of reinforced concrete at
East Orange, New Jersey, is 139 by 240 feet, with a height of
22<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub> feet. In the early days reinforced concrete was used for
water-pipes: more than a hundred miles of such pipes are now in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
service in Paris. Water-pipes on the Coignet system employ thin
steel rods hooked at both ends and curved into encircling hoops.
Other rods laid lengthwise run through the hooks, so as to hold
each part of the framework securely in place. At Newark, New
Jersey, 4,000 feet of single and 1,500 feet of double 60-inch conduits,
reinforced with 3-inch expanded steel, have been recently
laid.</p>

<p>The material thus available for systems of water supply is also
impressed into tasks of sewerage. In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,
a sewer of this kind three miles long
intercepts all other sewers, carrying
the whole stream below the city to an
outfall in the Susquehanna River. A
water culvert, for somewhat similar
duty, may on occasion be so heavily
reinforced as to carry railroad tracks
with safety, as in a <a href="#Fig267">culvert</a> for a
Western railroad shown in an accompanying
figure.</p>

<h3>New York Subway.</h3>

<p>Part of the New York Subway is
of reinforced concrete. Steel rods,
about 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches square were laid at
varying distances according to the different roof loads, from six
to ten inches apart. Rods 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inches in diameter tie the side
walls, passing through angle columns in the
walls and the bulb-angle columns in the centre.
Layers of concrete were laid over the roof rods
to a thickness of from eighteen to thirty inches, and carried two
inches below the rods, imbedding them. For the sides similar
square rods and concrete were used and angle columns five feet
apart. The concrete of the side walls is from fifteen to eighteen
inches thick.</p>

<h3>Bridges.</h3>

<p>At first, properly enough, reinforced concrete was adopted
with much caution in bridge-building. To-day hundreds of
bridges in this material are doing service
throughout the world. A good example of a
small bridge is that in Forest Park, St. Louis,
spanning the River des P&ecirc;res. A noteworthy design on a large
scale, by Professor William H. Burr, of Columbia University,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
New York, has been accepted for the Memorial Bridge to cross
the Potomac River at Washington. A centre-draw span of 159
feet in steel is to be flanked on each side by three spans of reinforced
concrete, each of 192 feet. These spans are ribbed
arches, having a rise of twenty-nine feet, with their exteriors in
granite masonry. In arguing for bridges in reinforced concrete,
Mr. Edwin Thacher points out that under normal circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
their steel is not strained to much more than one quarter of its
elastic limit, so that a large reserved strength is available for
emergencies, while the structure is more durable than a steel
bridge and ultimately more economical, comparatively free from
vibration and noise, proof against tornadoes and fire, and against
floods also if the foundations are protected from scour.</p>

</div>

<p class="chapstart">In every industry a threshold question is how motive power may
be had at the lowest cost. In this field within twenty years
wholly new methods have been introduced, while old processes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
have been greatly amended. Thanks to economical water-wheels
and generators, efficient transmission, and motors all but perfect,
water-powers, as at Niagara Falls, now send electricity to thousands
of distant workshops, to serve not only as an ideal means
of actuation, but as a source of light, heat and chemical impulse.
While electrical art has thus been marching forward, all the heat
engines have been improved in every detail of construction. New
valve-gears, economizers and superheaters, united with triple-expansion
cylinders of the boldest dimensions, worked at pressures
and speeds greater than ever before, combine to make the best
steam engines to-day vastly more effective than those of a generation
ago. And these engines are withal facing the aggressive
rivalry of the steam turbines devised by De Laval, Parsons and
Curtis, all much less heavy and bulky than engines, simpler to
build and operate, while their motion is continuous instead of interrupted
at every piston stroke.</p>

<p>Competing with steam motors are the new gas engines, twice as
efficient in converting heat into motive power. For this reason
and because much improvement seems to be feasible in their designs,
and in systems for supplying them with cheap gas, their
adoption on a large scale in the near future appears to be certain.
Especially will this be the event should the turbine principle be
as successfully applied to gas as to steam motors. Already gases
from coke ovens and blast furnaces, formerly thrown away or
used only in part, are being employed in gas engines with success.</p>

<p>To-day the production of motive power largely centres in
stations so huge that they adopt with gain appliances too elaborate
for use in small installations. At the power-house of the Interborough
Rapid Transit Company, New York, for example, automatic
machinery conveys coal from barges to vast bunkers under
the roof, an even distribution being effected by self-reversing
trippers. Twelve of the furnaces have automatic stokers. Ashes
are removed by conveyors. Lubricating oil is pumped to high
reservoirs whence it descends to flush all the bearings; it is then
carried to filters from which it passes to another round of duty.
It is plain that the huge scale of such a plant opens new doors to
ingenuity, especially in the dovetailing of one service with another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span></p>

<p>In some central stations, as at Findlay, Ada, and Springfield,
Ohio, the exhaust steam is utilized for district heating, so that
the generation of motive power is merged into the larger field of
fuel economy treated as a whole. Where there is a profitable
market for exhaust steam it pays to use a group of engines or
turbines which are either non-condensing, or only some of which
are condensing, for the aim is not simply to use the motor which
asks least fuel, but to install such motors and heaters as together
will earn most for the capital invested.</p>

<h3>Steam Engines.</h3>

<p>An experimental quadruple-expansion steam engine at Sibley
College, Cornell University, has consumed but 9.27 pounds of
steam of 500 pounds pressure per indicated
horse-power, with a mechanical efficiency of
86.88 per cent. An Allis-Chalmers compound
engine, tested December, 1905, at the Subway Power-house, New
York, developed 7,300 horse-power from steam at 175 pounds
pressure with a consumption of 11.96 pounds of steam per indicated
horse-power. The cylinders were not steam jacketed and
no reheaters were used. This engine has two horizontal high
pressure cylinders, 42 inches in diameter; and two vertical low
pressure cylinders, 86 inches in diameter; all of 60 inch stroke.
The four cylinders work on the same crank pin, with the effect of
two cranks at right angles to each other in superseded designs.
A <a href="#Fig271">similar engine</a>, less powerful, is shown opposite this page.</p>

<h3>Mechanical Draft.</h3>

<p>At this point let us put back the clock a little that we may understand
why tallness in chimneys is much less in vogue for steam
plants than formerly, and why this change is
found to be well worth while. A device at least
two centuries old is the smoke-jack, of which a
specimen lingers here and there in the museums and curiosity
shops of England. The rotary motion of its vanes, due to the
upward draft from a kitchen fire, was employed to turn a joint of
meat as it roasted in front of the coals. To-day the successors of
this primitive heat-mill are the cardboard or mica toys which,
fastened to a stove-pipe, or close to a lamp chimney, set at work
a carpenter with his saw, a laundress with her sad-iron, and so
on. These playthings show us the simplest way in which heat can
yield motive power; because simplest it prevails almost universally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
and yet it is wasteful in the extreme. Nobody for a
moment would think of putting a wheel like that of a smoke-jack
in a chimney so that the rising
stream of hot gases might
drive a sewing-machine or a
churn, and yet for a task just
as mechanical, namely, the
pushing upward a chimney
current itself, the heating that
current to an extreme temperature
is to-day the usual
plan. Under good design the
gases of combustion are obliged
to do all the work that
can be squeezed out of them;
then and only then they are
sent into the chimney. What
if their temperature be so low,
comparatively, that their rise
in the stack, if left to themselves,
is slow as compared with the rise in another stack of
gases 300&deg; hotter? One hundredth part, or even less, of the
saved heat when applied through an engine to a fan will ensure
as quick a breeze through the grate-bars as if the chimney gases
were wastefully hot, and this while the chimney is but one eighth
to one fourth as tall as an old-fashioned structure. This is the
reason why mechanical draft is now adopted far and wide in
factories, mills and power-houses. The advantages which follow
are manifold: the plant is rendered independent of wind and
weather, inferior fuels are thoroughly and quickly consumed, at
times of uncommon demand a fire can be easily forced so as to
increase the duty of the boilers. To-day in the best practice the
feed water for the boilers is heated by the furnace gases just before
they enter the stack; the piping for this purpose, formed into
coils known as economizers, checks the chimney draft. This
checking is readily overcome by mechanical draft, leaving the
engineer a considerable net gain as fan and economizer are united.
One incidental advantage in modern plants of sound design, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
good management, is that they send forth but little smoke or none
at all. With thorough combustion no smoke whatever leaves the
stack.</p>

<div class="figc300" id="Fig272">
<img src="images/illo513.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="384" />
<p class="caption">Smoke-jack.</p>
</div>

<h3>Automatic Stoking.</h3>

<p>The avoidance of smoke is promoted by the use of well designed
mechanical stokers: two of the best are the Roney and
the Jones models. The Jones apparatus forces
its fuel into the fire from beneath, so that its
gases, passing upward through blazing coal,
are thoroughly consumed.</p>

<h3>Boilers.</h3>

<p>In large plants the boilers are usually of the water-tube variety,
working at high pressures which may be increased at need. Mr.
Walter B. Snow says:<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a
href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>&mdash;&#8220;Until the recent past
the steam generator or boiler and the manner
of its operation received far less attention than
they deserved. Although under the best conditions over 80 per
cent. of the full calorific value of the fuel may be utilized in the
production of steam, this high standard is seldom reached in
ordinary practice. Mr. J. C. Hoadley showed an efficiency of
nearly 88 per cent. in his tests of a warm-blast steam-boiler
furnace with air-heaters and mechanical draft, while Mr. W. H.
Bryan has reported eighty-six tests conducted under common
conditions with ordinary fuel, upon boilers of various types, which
indicate an average efficiency of only 58 per cent., and have a
range between a minimum of 34.6 per cent. obtained with a small
vertical boiler, and a maximum of 81.32 per cent. with a water-tube
boiler of improved setting. The possibilities of increased
economy in ordinary boiler practice are thus clearly evident.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Superheaters.</h3>

<p>A cardinal improvement in steam engineering of late years has
been in perfecting superheaters; this advance owes much to the
mineral oils now available for lubrication at
temperatures which may be as high as 675&deg;
Fahr. As steam expands to perform work it
falls in temperature and much of it condenses as water, with
marked loss of efficiency, with harm to its containers by severe
hammering. A superheater avoids this trouble by so raising the
initial temperature of the steam that condensation either ceases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
altogether or is much lessened. The apparatus is usually a nest
of tubes placed in the fire-box close to the boiler; or, the tubes
may be heated by a fire of their own, away from the boiler. The
Schmidt superheater has long, parallel bent tubes, connecting
two parallel headers. It may be directly applied to locomotive
boilers without essential modification, and without checking the
draft. On the Canadian Pacific Railway about two hundred
simple locomotives have been provided with superheaters, lowering
the coal consumption to 87, 85, 83 and as little as 76 per cent.
in comparison with compound engines having no superheaters.
At St. Louis in 1904 the Pennsylvania Railroad conducted
elaborate tests of diverse locomotives. The most economical
compound engine each hour used 18.6 pounds of ordinary saturated
steam per indicated horse-power. Aided by a superheater
this consumption was reduced to 16.6 pounds, a saving of 10.75
per cent. See page 241. In Germany portable steam engines of
150 to 220 horse-power, superheating their steam 150&deg; to 170&deg;
Centigrade above the temperature of saturation have, in compound
types, reduced their demand for steam to 12.47 pounds per horse-power
hour and, in a triple-expansion model, to 9.97 pounds. In
all cases the steam pipe takes the shortest possible path between
its superheater and its cylinder.</p>

<h3>Improved Condensers.</h3>

<p>By an improved design Professor R. L. Weighton of Armstrong
College, Newcastle-on-Tyne, has doubled the efficiency of
the surface condenser, and reduced its consumption
of water 44 per cent. In his apparatus
the condensing water enters at the base,
and leaves at the top, after several circuits instead of but two as
in the ordinary condenser. This new apparatus is drained off in
sections, instead of allowing the condensed steam to accumulate
at the bottom, as in common practice. This sectional drainage is
effected by dividing the interior into diaphragms somewhat inclined
to the horizontal, so that the water of condensation is removed
as fast as formed and does not flow from the upper tubes
over those beneath. The gain in this arrangement arises from
the fact that the greater part of the condensation takes place in
the upper part of a condenser, where the steam impinges first
upon the tubes. The Weighton apparatus, in conjunction with
dry air-pumps, shows a condensation of 36 pounds of steam per
square foot of surface per hour, with a reduction of pressure to
one twentieth of barometric pressure (1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches as compared
with 30), using as condensing water 28 times as much as the feed
water, at an inlet temperature of 50&deg; Fahr.</p>

<h3>Steam Turbines.</h3>

<p>For a long time, and well into the nineteenth century, water was
lifted by pistons moving in cylindrical pumps. Meantime the
turbine grew steadily in favor as a water-motor,
arriving at last at high efficiency. This
gave designers a hint to reverse the turbine
and use it as a water lifter or pump: this machine, duly built, with
a continuous instead of an intermittent motion, showed much
better results than the old-fashioned pump. The turbine-pump
is accordingly adopted for many large waterworks, deep mines
and similar installations. This advance from to-and-fro to rotary
action extended irresistibly to steam as a motive power. It was
clear that if steam could be employed in a turbine somewhat as
water is, much of the complexity and loss inherent in reciprocating
engines would be brushed aside. A pioneer inventor in this field
was Gustave Patrick De Laval, of Stockholm, who constructed
his first steam turbine along the familiar lines of the Barker mill.
Steam is so light that for its utmost utilization as a jet a velocity<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
of about 2,000 feet a second is required, a rate which no material
is strong enough to allow. De Laval by using the most tenacious
metals for his turbines is able to give their swiftest parts a speed
of as much as 1400 feet a second. His apparatus is cheap, simple
and efficient; it is limited to about 300 horse-power. Its chief feature
is its divergent nozzle, which permits the outflowing steam to
expand fully with all the effect realized in a steam cylinder provided
with expansion valve gear. Another device of De Laval
which makes his turbine a safe and desirable prime mover is the
flexible shaft which has a little, self-righting play under the extreme
pace of its rotation.</p>

</div>

<h3>The Parsons Steam Turbine.</h3>

<p>Of direct action turbines the De Laval is the chief; of compound
turbines, in which the steam is expanded in successive
stages, the first and most widely adopted was
invented by the Hon. Charles A. Parsons of
Newcastle-on-Tyne. From an address of his
to the Institute of Electrical Engineers, early
in 1905, the following narrative has been taken<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;In the early days of electric lighting the speed of dynamos was
far above that of the engines which drove them, and therefore
belts and other forms of gearing had to be resorted to. To make
a high-speed engine, therefore, was of considerable importance,
and this led to the possibilities of the steam turbine being considered.
It was at once seen that the speed of any single turbine
wheel driven by steam would be excessive without gearing, and
in order to obtain direct driving it was necessary to adopt the
compound form, in which there were a number of turbines in
series, and thus, the steam being expanded by small increments,
the velocity of rotation was reduced to moderate limits. Even
then, for the small sizes of the dynamos at that time in use, the
speed was high, and therefore a special dynamo had to be designed.
Speaking generally, an increase of speed of a dynamo
increases its output, and therefore it was obvious that such a high-speed
dynamo would be very economical of material.</p>

</div><!--figc600-->

<p>&#8220;These considerations led, in 1884, to the first compound steam
turbine being constructed. It was of about 10 horse-power and
ran at 300 revolutions per second, the diameter of the armature
being about three inches. This machine, which worked satisfactorily
for some years, is now in the South Kensington Museum.
Turbines afterward constructed had two groups of 15 successive
turbine wheels, or rows of blades, on one drum or shaft within a
concentric case on the right and left of the steam inlet, the moving
blades or vanes being in circumferential rows projecting outwardly
from the shaft and nearly touching the case, and the fixed
or guide blades being similarly formed and projecting inwardly
from the case and nearly touching the shaft. A series of turbine
wheels on one shaft were thus constituted, and each one complete
in itself is like a parallel-flow water turbine, the steam, after performing
its work in each turbine, passing on to the next, and
preserving its longitudinal velocity without shock, gradually falling
in pressure as it passes through each row of blades, and
gradually expanding. Each successive row of blades was slightly
larger in passage way than the preceding to allow for the increasing
bulk of the elastic steam, and thus the velocity of flow
was regulated so as to operate with the greatest degree of efficiency
on each turbine of the series. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It constituted an ideal<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
rotary engine, but it had limitations. The comparatively high
speed of rotation necessary for so small an engine, made it difficult
to avoid a whipping or springing of the shaft, so that considerable
clearances were found obligatory, and leakage and loss of efficiency
resulted. It was perceived that these defects would decrease
as the engine was enlarged, with a corresponding reduction
of velocity. In 1888 therefore several turbo-alternators were built
for electric lighting stations, all of the parallel-flow type and non-condensing.
In 1894 the machines were much improved, the
blade was bettered in its form, and throughout greater mechanical
strength was attained. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To-day (1905) under 140 pounds
steam pressure, 100&deg; Fahr. superheat, and a vacuum of 27 inches,
the barometer being at 30 inches, the consumptions are in round
numbers as follows<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>A 100-kilowatt (134 horse-power) plant
takes about 25 pounds of steam per kilowatt-hour at full load, a
200-kilowatt (268 horse-power) takes 22 pounds, a 500-kilowatt
(670 horse-power) takes 19 pounds, a 1,500-kilowatt (2,010 horse-power)
18 pounds, and a 3,000-kilowatt (4,020 horse-power) 16
pounds (or 12 pounds per horse-power-hour). Without superheat
the consumptions are about 10 per cent. more, and every 10&deg;
Fahr. of superheat up to about 150&deg; lowers the consumption about
1 per cent.</p>

<p>&#8220;A good vacuum is of great importance in a turbine, as the expansion
can be carried in the turbine right down to the vacuum
of the condenser, a function which is practically impossible in the
case of a reciprocating engine, on account of the excessive size
of the low-pressure cylinder, ports, passages and valves which
would be required. Every inch of vacuum between 23 and 28
inches lowers the consumption about 3 per cent. in a 100-kilowatt,
4 per cent. in a 500-kilowatt, and 5 per cent. in a 1,500-kilowatt
turbine, the effect being more at high vacua and less at low.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Marine Steam Turbines.</h3>

<p>In 1894 Mr. Parsons launched his &#8220;Turbinia,&#8221; the first steamer
to be driven by a turbine. Her record was so gratifying that a
succession of vessels, similarly equipped, were
year by year built for excursion lines, for transit
across the British Channel, for the British
Royal Navy, and for mercantile marine service.
The thirty-fifth of these ships, the &#8220;Victorian&#8221; of the Allan Line,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
was the first to cross the Atlantic Ocean, arriving at Halifax, Nova
Scotia, April 18, 1905. She was followed by the &#8220;Virginian&#8221; of
the same line which arrived at Quebec, May 8, 1905. Not long
afterward the Cunard Company sent from Liverpool to New
York the &#8220;Carmania&#8221; equipped with steam turbines, and in every
other respect like the &#8220;Caronia&#8221; of the same owners, which is
driven by reciprocating engines of the best model. Thus far the
comparison between these two ships is in favor of the &#8220;Carmania.&#8221;
The new monster Cunarders, the &#8220;Lusitania&#8221; and the
&#8220;Mauretania,&#8221; each of 70,000 horse-power, are to be propelled by
steam turbines. The principal reasons for this preference are thus
given by Professor Carl C. Thomas<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Decreased cost of operation as regards fuel, labor, oil, and
repairs.</p>

<p>Vibration due to machinery is avoided.</p>

<p>Less weight of machinery and coal to be carried, resulting in
greater speed.</p>

<p>Greater simplicity of machinery in construction and operation,
causing less liability to accident and breakdown.</p>

<p>Smaller and more deeply immersed propellers, decreasing the
tendency of the machinery to race in rough weather.</p>

<p>Lower centre of gravity of the machinery as a whole, and increased
headroom above the machinery.</p>

<p>According to recent reports, decreased first cost of machinery.<a

<h3>Gas-Power.</h3>

<p class="chapstart">Steam as motive power finds its most formidable rival in
cheap gases, whose familiar varieties have been long used
for illumination. A simple experiment shows with what ease gas
can be made, which, duly cooled, may be carried long distances
without the condensation which subtracts from
the value of steam. Take a narrow tube of
metal or Jena glass, open at both ends: put one
end near the wick of a burning candle, at the other end apply a
lighted match, and at once a flame bursts forth. Here is a
miniature gas-works; close to the wick inflammable gases are generated
by the heat, before they have time to burn they are conveyed
through the tube to a point a foot distant where, on ignition,
they yield a brilliant flame. Enlarge this operation so that instead
of an ounce of wax you distill tons of coal from hundreds of big
retorts; set up a gas-holder as huge as the dome of the Capitol at
Washington; instead of short tube lay miles of pipe through the
avenues and streets of a city, and a trivial experiment widens into
lighting a hundred thousand homes. So much for dividing combustion
in halves, by conducting gasification in one place on a vast
scale, and burning the produced gas whenever and wherever you
please. One supreme advantage of the process is that coal, wood
and other sources of gas much cheaper than wax or oil can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
employed. Alongside the retorts which gasify coal or wood are
built scrubbers which remove substances undesired in the gas,&mdash;tar,
sulphur, and so on,&mdash;all salable at good prices. It was in 1792
that William Murdock, an assistant to James Watt at the Soho
Works near Birmingham, there originated gas-lighting. His
enterprise was a seed-plot for
a variety of industries which
have reached commanding
importance, and are to-day
expanding faster than ever
before. Illuminating gas
from its first introduction has
on occasion wrought disaster;
when it leaks through
a joint into a room it rapidly
unites with air; instantly on
the intrusion of a flame there
is a violent explosion, that is,
an abrupt output of enormous
energy set free under circumstances
which do only harm.
Can the energy, as in the case
of blasting, be usefully directed?</p>

<p class="caption">Combustible gas from a candle is taken
through a tube to a distance and
there burnt.</p>
</div>

<p>Yes, as long ago as 1794, Robert Street designed a pump driven
by the explosion of turpentine vapor below the motor piston. He
was followed by inventors who used illuminating gas as their
propelling agent; among these, in 1860, was Lenoir of Paris, who
built a double-acting engine with a jump-spark electric igniter
such as to-day is in general use. His engine consumed 95 feet of
gas per hour for each horse-power, which meant that commercially
the engine was a failure. Lenoir&#8217;s design has been so much improved
that now large gas engines yield in motive power one fifth
of the whole value of their fuel, an efficiency twice that of the best
steam engines or turbines, and five-fold better than that of
Lenoir&#8217;s apparatus.</p>

<h3>Producer Gas.</h3>

<p>How this remarkable result has been attained we shall consider
a little further on, as we briefly examine the construction of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
typical <a href="#GasEngine">gas engine</a>. At this point let us note how a gas, suitable
for an engine, is manufactured at least cost, the outlay being
much less than in the case of illuminating gas which represents
but one third of the coal placed in the distilling retorts. Instead
of this process of distillation, &#8220;producer&#8221; gas
is due to a modified combustion which gasifies
all the fuel. In a producer of standard type,
atmospheric oxygen comes into contact with the glowing carbon of
the coal or wood, forming carbon dioxide, CO&sup2;. The heat generated
by this union is taken up by the carbon dioxide and the
nitrogen of the supplied air. These gases as they rise through the
fuel bring it to incandescence so that the carbon dioxide takes up
another atom of carbon, becoming carbon monoxide, CO, a highly
combustible gas. Were there no impurities in the fuel, were the
entering air quite free from moisture, the gases would be in volume
34.7 per cent. carbon monoxide and 65.3 per cent. nitrogen,
with a heating value per cubic foot of about 118 British thermal
units, a unit being the heat needed to raise a pound of water to
40&deg; Fahr. from 39&deg;, where its density is at the maximum. Gas
thus produced is intensely hot; and as usually it contains sulphur,
dust, dirt, and other admixtures, their removal by water in a
scrubber would involve a waste of about 30 per cent. of the fuel
heat. This loss is much diminished by sending into the producer
not only air but steam, to be decomposed into oxygen and hydrogen;
the oxygen combines with carbon to form more carbon
monoxide, while the hydrogen is the most valuable heating ingredient
in the emitted stream of gases. Were only air sent
through the producer, the outflowing gases would contain nitrogen
to the extent of 65 per cent.; with a charge in part air and in part
steam, this percentage falls to 52; as nitrogen is useless and wastefully
absorbs heat, this reduction of its quantity is gainful. By a
duly regulated admission of steam, a producer is kept at a temperature
high enough to decompose steam, but not so high as to
send forth gases unduly hot to the purifier.</p>

<p>For water-gas the method is to blow steam into the fuel until
decomposition ceases; the steam is then shut off, the fire allowed
to recover intense heat, when more steam is injected, and so on
intermittently.</p>

</div>

<h3>A Gas Producer.</h3>

<p>Producer gas is in more extensive use than water-gas. It is
evolved in apparatus of many good designs: let us glance at the
Taylor gas producer built by R. D. Wood &amp;
Company, Philadelphia. Its fuel enters in a
steady stream, in controlled quantity, through
a Bildt automatic feed which has a constantly rotating distributor
with deflecting surfaces. The incandescent fuel is carried on a
bed of ashes several feet thick, so
that the coal gradually burns out
and cools before its ashes are discharged.
Through a conduit an
airblast is carried up through
this layer of ashes to where the
fuel is aglow; united with this
airblast is a pipe admitting steam;
the united air and steam are
emitted radially. In the producer
walls are sight or test holes so
placed that the line dividing ashes
from glowing fuel may at any
time be observed. When this line
becomes higher on one side than
the other, scrapers, duly arranged,
are used. At the bottom of the
producer is a Taylor rotative
table which grinds out the ashes
as fast as they rise above the desired
depth, say every six to
twenty-four hours, according to
the rate of working. In large producers
the ash bed is kept about
three and a half feet deep, so that
any coal that may pass the point of air admission has ample time
to burn entirely out: in a producer with an ordinary grate such
coal would fall wastefully into the ashpit. As the Taylor ash
table turns it grinds the lower part of the fuel bed, closing any
channels formed by the airblast, and restraining the formation of
carbon dioxide, a useless product, to a minimum. A few impulses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
of the crank at frequent intervals maintain the fuel in solid condition,
reducing the need of poking from above.</p>

<p>Other American producers differ from the Wood apparatus in
details of design and operation; in principle all are much alike.
Any good producer works well with cheap fuels, bituminous coals
of inferior quality, culm, lignite, wood, peat, tanbark, and even
straw from the thresher. With each of these there must be due
modification of mechanism, together with means of forcing air
and steam into the fire. A suction plant may be employed when
superior fuels are burned, coke, anthracite, or charcoal; with currents
of air and steam automatically drawn into the producer,
the surrounding room is not likely to be filled with the harmful
gases which may be occasionally ejected by a pressure plant.</p>

<h3>Mond Gas.</h3>

<p>England has gas-power installations much larger and more
elaborate than those of America. Of these the most extensive
have been built by the Power-gas Corporation
in London, under the patents of Mond, Duff
and Talbot. A Mond plant yields a gas having
84 per cent. of the calorific value of the coal consumed, which may
be slack at six shillings, $1.46, per ton. Where more than thirty
tons of coal per day are used, it is worth while intercepting the
sulphate of ammonia, amounting to 90 pounds per ton of coal,
which in small producers cannot readily be seized. Mond gas
is free from tar, is cleansed of soot and dust, and holds less sulphur
than ordinary producer gas. Operation is simple enough:
first of all the slack is brought into hoppers above the producers.
From these it is fed in charges, of from 300 to 1,000 pounds, into
the producer bell, where the first heating takes place: the products
of distillation pass downward into the hot zone of fuel before
joining the bulk of gas leaving the producer. This converts the
tar into a fixed gas, and prepares the slack for descent into the
body of the producer, where it is acted upon by an airblast saturated
with steam at 185&deg; Fahr., and superheated before coming
into contact with the fuel. The stream of hot gases from the
producer now traverses a washer, a rectangular iron chamber with
side lutes, where a water spray thrown by revolving dashers brings
down the temperature of the gases to about 194&deg; Fahr. In plants
which recover the ammonia sulphate, the gas takes its way through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
a lead-lined tower, filled with tiles of large surface, where it meets
a downward flow of acid liquor, circulated by pumps, containing
ammonia sulphate with about 4 per cent. excess of free sulphuric
acid. Combination of the ammonia with this free acid ensues,
yielding still more ammonia sulphate. The gases, freed from
their ammonia, are conducted into a cooling tower, where they
meet a descending shower of cold water effecting a further
cleansing before the gases enter the main pipe for delivery to consumers.
In its general plan, a Mond plant resembles an illuminating
gas works, especially in its seizure of profitable by-products.
A ton of slack costing in England $1.46 yields 90 pounds
of ammonia sulphate worth $1.92 or thereabout.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<h3>Blast Furnace Gases.</h3>

<p>For many years flames from blast furnaces and coke ovens testified
to the waste of valuable gases, in especial the combustible carbon
monoxide which is the main ingredient in
producer gas. When we learn that coal or coke
in iron-smelting parts with but three per cent.
of its heat to the ore, we begin to see how grievous was the waste
so long endured. For a few years past the gases sent forth from
blast furnaces have been employed to heat the incoming air for
the blowers, and to raise steam for engines. With twice the efficiency
of steam motors the gas engine renders it well worth while
to rid furnace gases of their dust and dirt so that they may not
injure the mechanism they impel. An effective cleanser acts by
separating the gases from their admixtures by centrifugal force.
At the Lackawanna Steel Works, Buffalo, N. Y., eight gas-engines,
each of 1,000 horse-power, are run on blast furnace gases.
It may well prove that installations of this kind will bring other
blast furnaces into cities where the sale of electricity will form a
large item in the profits.</p>

<p class="caption">Four-cycle gas engine. I, admission valve.
O, exhaust valve.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="GasEngine">Gas Engines.</h3>

<p>The first gas engines used gas and air at ordinary atmospheric
pressure; at due intervals the charge was exploded by a glowing
hot tube exposed by a slide-valve, or, according
to the practice now general, by an electric spark
of the jump variety. In 1862 De Rochas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
patented, and in 1876 Otto built, an engine on a model still in
favor. Its cardinal feature is the compression of each charge.
In the field of steam practice, we know how great economy is realized
by beginning work with high pressures. A similar gain attends
the compression of gases in a cylinder before explosion;
whatever their pressure before ignition, it is trebled or quadrupled
by ignition, returning a handsome profit on the work of compression,
The four-cycle operation devised by De Rochas proceeds
thus<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>First, by drawing in a mixture of gas and air in due percentages
during an outward stroke of the piston. Second, this
charge is compressed by an inward piston stroke. Third, the compression
charge is ignited, preferably by an electric spark, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
the piston moves outward by virtue of a pressure initially extreme.
Fourth, the exhaust valve opens and the spent gases are
ejected as the piston returns to complete its cycle. As but one of
the four piston journeys is a working stroke, it is necessary to
employ a heavy flywheel to equalize the motion of the engine.
When two or more engines are united, their piston rods are so
connected to a common shaft as to distribute the working strokes
with the best balancing effect. With four engines their piston
rods may be arranged at distances apart of 90 degrees, so that one
working stroke is always being exerted. This plan is adopted for
the gasoline engines of automobiles so that they are served by
fly-wheels comparatively small.</p>

<p>In his work on the gas engine, Professor F. R. Hutton discusses
the advantages and disadvantages of that motor.<a name="FNanchor_41"

<p>The heat energy acts directly upon the piston, without intervening
appliances. Fuel economy is greater than with steam, because
there is no furnace or chimney to waste any heat. No fuel
is wasted in starting the motor, or after the engine stops. The
bulk, weight and cost of a furnace and boiler are eliminated, as
well as their losses by radiation. A gas motor has a portability
which lends itself to important industries, as logging and lumbering.
It may be started at once, with no delay as in getting up a
fire under a boiler; when the fuel-supply is cut off, the motor
stops and needs no attention: these are important in automobile
practice. Gas engines are gainfully united to systems of gas
storage so that a producer may be run at high efficiency when convenient,
and its gas held in holders till needed: this is helpful
when a plant is worked overtime, or is liable to stresses of extreme
demand at certain hours of the day. Incident to this is the
advantage of subdividing power units in a large plant: each motor
may receive its gas in pipes without loss, to be operated at will.
The rapidity of flame propagation renders possible a high number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
of shaft rotations per minute, so that a multi-cylinder engine
weighs little in comparison with its power. There is no liability
to boiler explosion, or trouble from impurities deposited by water
in a boiler. There is no exposed flame or fuel-bed requiring attention.
The mechanism of the motor is simple, and its moving
parts are few. A gas or oil engine furthermore enjoys a combustion
which is smokeless. The fuel requires no diluting excess
of air, with its cooling effect and incidental waste of energy.
Dust, sparks and ashes are avoided, with diminished risk of fire.
Liquid or gaseous fuel can be served by pumps or blowers so that
the cost of handling is avoided.</p>

<p>As to disadvantages<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>In a four-cycle engine there is but one
working stroke in four piston traverses. In a two-cycle engine
there is one working stroke in two traverses. For a given mean
pressure the cylinder of a gas engine must be larger than a double
acting steam cylinder. In single cylinder gas engines the crank
effort is irregular; hence a heavy fly-wheel is required, or, a number
of cylinders must be joined together, adding much weight.
The motor does not start by the simple motion of a lever or valve.
It has to be started by an auxiliary apparatus stored with energy
enough to cause one working stroke. A steam engine may be
overloaded to meet brief demands for extra power: not so with
a gas engine. The extreme temperatures of the cylinder require
cooling systems by air or water, adding weight and involving
waste of energy; these temperatures furthermore may seriously
distort the mechanism while rendering lubrication difficult and
uncertain. Explosions of some violence may occur in exhaust pipes
and passages, unless the engine is carefully adjusted and operated.
Imperfect combustion clogs the working parts with soot or
lampblack, especially injuring the ignition appliances. Initial
pressures are so high as to cause vibration and jar. Governing is
not easy, since explosion is all but instantaneous. The normal
motor runs at maximum efficiency only when running at a certain
speed. To vary that speed is much more troublesome and wasteful
of energy than with the steam engine.</p>

<p>Gas engines united to gas producers have been employed with
success on shipboard. This field, with its high premium on fuel
reduction, which means more space for cargo, is likely to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
largely developed in the near future. Soon, also, we may expect
locomotives to exhibit a like combination with profitable results.</p>

<h3>Steam and Gas Engines Compared.</h3>

<p>During 1904 and 1905 the U. S. Geological Survey compared
at St. Louis a steam engine with a gas engine, each of 250 horse-power,
using 24 varieties of lignites and bituminous
coals. The steam engine was of a
simple, non-condensing, unjacketed Corliss
type, from the Allis-Chalmers Company, Milwaukee.
The gas engine was a three-cylinder, vertical model
from the Westinghouse Machine Company, Pittsburg. Its gas
was supplied by a Taylor gas producer furnished by R. D. Wood
&amp; Company, Philadelphia, of the design illustrated on page 460.</p>

<p>The official report in three parts, fully illustrated, presenting
the tests in detail, was published by the Survey early in 1906. On
page 978, of the second part, 14 comparative tests are summarized.
They show that in the gas plant on an average 1.70 pounds of fuel
were consumed in producing for one hour one electrical horse-power;
in the steam plant the consumption was 4.29 pounds, two
and a half times as much. With apparatus adapted to a particular
fuel, with larger and more economical engines, better results
would have been shown both by steam and gas. Yet competent
critics believe that the ratio of net results would have remained
much the same. The most important fact brought out in the
tests is that some fuels, lignites from North Dakota for example,
have little worth in raising steam, and high value in producing
gas; their moisture is a detriment under a boiler, it is an advantage
in a gas producer. The cost of this investigation is likely to be
repaid many thousand-fold in pointing out the best way to use
fuels which abound in the Western and Northwestern States and
in Canada. See <a href="#Footnote_30">note</a>, page 241.</p>

<h3>Oil Engines.</h3>

<p>In some cases petroleum is the best available fuel for an engine,
essentially much the same as a gas motor. A carburetor, or atomizer,
blows the oil into a fine mist almost as inflammable
as gas. In small sizes for launches,
threshing machines, or work-shops of limited
area, the petroleum engine is a capital servant. In sizes of 75
horse-power and upward the Diesel engine is not only the best oil
engine but the most efficient heat-motor ever invented. It involves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
a principle as important as that of Watt&#8217;s separate condenser for
the steam from his cylinder.</p>

<div class="figc450" id="Fig281">
<img src="images/illo537.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="49" />
<p class="caption">Fire Syringe.</p>
</div>

<p>To understand the Diesel principle let us begin by remembering
that to the compression of a charge in a gas engine there is a
moderate limit; if this be exceeded the heat of compression
prematurely ignites the gases, so as to prevent due action. The
air in a bicycle tire is compressed but moderately, and yet every
man who has worked a bicycle air-pump with energy knows that
soon its cylinder grows warm to the touch. On this very principle,
that mechanical work is convertible into heat, our grandfathers
had an ingenious mode of producing fire. In a syringe
with a glass barrel they placed a piston fitting snugly. In a cavity
of this piston they fastened a bit of cotton wool soaked in bisulphide
of carbon. On forcing the piston suddenly into the cylinder,
the air, quickly compressed, became hot enough to set the cotton
wool on fire. The heat evolved in the compression of air is turned
to account in the Diesel oil engine so as to make it the most economical
converter of heat into work ever devised. First the mechanism
compresses air alone to 500 pounds per square inch, then
and then only the oil for combustion is injected, to take fire instantly
from the heat of the compressed air. A governor regulates
the period of burning; this is usually during one tenth part
of the stroke, the expansion of the burned products completing
the stroke. Because 500 pounds is a pressure out of the question
for the compression of the mixed charge of air and combustible
gas in an ordinary gas cylinder, the Diesel engine excels in economy
any gas engine thus far built. At Ghent in 1903 a Diesel engine
developed 165 brake horse-power from crude Texas oil with
the extraordinary net efficiency of 32.3 per cent. At the St. Louis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
Exposition, 1904, three Diesel engines, using oil costing three
cents per gallon, delivered for seven months, during eleven hours
each day, at half-load, an average of 250 kilowatts at an expense
for fuel of but three tenths of one cent per kilowatt hour on
the switchboard, including all generator and line losses. Engineers
of the first rank are convinced that the Diesel principle
may be successfully embodied in gas engines. That done, with a
success approaching the effectiveness of Diesel&#8217;s oil motor, we
may expect steam engines and turbines to be largely dismissed
from service.</p>

<h3>Gasoline Engines.</h3>

<p>Gasoline, although higher in price than petroleum, is commonly
used in automobiles and launches. It can be atomized more
quickly and fully, and without heat. To equalize
motion, minimize jars, and reduce the
weight of its fly-wheel, an automobile of high
power has usually four cylinders with cranks set at an angle of 90
degrees with each other. The inlet valve is operated positively
and, as a rule, is interchangeable with the exhaust valve. The
ignition spark is furnished by a motor-driven magneto, or by a
battery operating an induction coil; the lubricant is distributed by
a sight-feed system, hand regulated. Cooling is effected by water
circulated by a pump through jackets surrounding all cylinders
and valves, each jacket having a surface of the utmost extent upon
which a swiftly rotated fan drives a stream of air.</p>

<h3>Alcohol Engines.</h3>

<p>For some years France and Germany have used alcohol as a
fuel in engines, no excise tax being imposed on alcohol employed
for industrial purposes. On January 1, 1907,
this will also be the case in the United States, so
that we may expect alcohol to take a leading
place as fuel in motors. &#8220;It has,&#8221; says Professor Elihu Thomson,
&#8220;gallon for gallon less heating power than gasoline, but equal
efficiency in an internal combustion engine, because it throws away
less heat in waste gases and in the water jacket. A mixture of
alcohol vapor with air stands a much higher compression than
does a mixture of gasoline and air without premature explosion. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
There is now beginning an application of the internal combustion
engine for railroad cars on short lines which are feeders
to main lines. The growth of this business may be hampered in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
the near future by the cost of gasoline. In this case alcohol, producible
in unlimited amount, could be substituted.&#8221;</p>

<p>An important advantage in using alcohol is its comparative
safety. In case of fire oils and gasolines float on the water intended
to quench a blaze; alcohol blends with that water and the
flame is subdued.</p>

<p>Whether oil, gasoline or alcohol be their fuel, internal combustion
motors gain steadily in public acceptance. On the farm
they are gradually displacing the horse. An engine, which costs
nothing when it is idle, shells corn, saws wood, cuts fodder, grinds
feed, separates and churns cream, drives a thrasher, turns a mill,
lifts water, and performs a hundred other chores quickly, simply
and cheaply.</p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO&sup2;) is absorbed by a solution of caustic potash.
The Ados recorder based upon this absorption has enabled
Mr. Stott to learn the proportion of carbon dioxide in the gases
passing to the stack, the higher that proportion, the more thorough
the combustion. He finds first as an element of economy careful
firing, so as to avoid &#8220;holes&#8221; or thin places in a fire, through
which air wastefully pours, chilling the furnace. Next in importance
is adapting draft to fuel: small anthracite requires a
draft of 1.5 inches of water; with a draft of but .2 inch of water
one pound of dry bituminous coal has evaporated 10.6 pounds of
water, with a draft of 1 inch this fell to 8.7 pounds. Mr. Stott
estimates that scientific methods of firing can reduce losses to the
stack to 12.7 per cent., and possibly to 10 per cent.</p>

<p>Respecting the loss of 8 per cent. in boiler radiation and leakage,
he maintains that this is largely due to the inefficient setting
of brick which, besides permitting radiation, admits much air by
infiltration. The remedy is to employ the best methods of boiler
setting, such as an iron-plate air-tight case enclosing a carbonate
of magnesia lining outside the brickwork.</p>

<p>Regarding the main loss, that of 60.1 per cent. to the condenser,
Mr. Stott points out that superheating could reduce this by 6 per
cent. He observes that in the higher pressures of a steam cycle
a reciprocating engine has an advantage, while in the lower pressures
a steam turbine is more efficient. Combine them, he remarks,
and use each where it is the more profitable. But in his
view for the utmost economy a new type of plant should unite
both steam and gas driven units.</p>

<p>&#8220;Over a year ago,&#8221; he says, &#8220;while watching the effect of
putting a large steam turbine having a sensitive governor in connection
with reciprocating engine-driven units having sluggish
governors, it occurred to me that here was the solution of the gas
engine problem; for the turbine immediately proceeded to act like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
an ideal storage battery; that is, a storage battery whose potential
will not fall at the moment of taking up load, for all the load
fluctuations of the plant were taken up by the steam turbine, and
the reciprocating engines went on carrying almost constant loads,
whilst the turbine load fluctuated between nothing and 8,000 kilowatts
in periods of less than ten seconds.</p>

<p>&#8220;The combination of gas engines and steam turbines in a single
plant promises improved efficiency whilst removing the objection
to the gas engine, namely, its inability to carry heavy overloads.
A steam turbine can easily be designed to take care of 100 per
cent. overload for a few seconds; and as the load fluctuation in
any plant will probably not average more than 25 per cent. with a
maximum of 50 per cent. for a few seconds, it would seem that if
a plant were designed to operate normally with one half its capacity
in gas engines and one half in steam turbines, any fluctuations
of load likely to arise in practice could be taken care of.&#8221;</p>

<p>Discussing in detail the performance of such a plant, Mr. Stott
concludes that its average total thermal efficiency would be 24.5
per cent., as against 10.3 per cent. in the plant whose record he
had presented.</p>

<h3>Heating and Power Production United.</h3>

<p>In the bill of particulars drawn up by Mr. Stott it was shown
that no less than 60.1 per cent. of the total heat from his fuel had
gone into the condenser where, joined to the
stream of the East River, it had been wasted.
Had he used non-condensing motors the loss in
exhausts would have been larger, and yet when
a non-condensing motor is joined to a heating plant the whole
investment may be much more profitable than where condensing
motors throw away all the heat of their exhausts. Long ago some
pioneer of unrecorded name, using a non-condensing steam engine,
warmed his factory or mill with its exhaust steam. In summer
that steam sped idly into the air, in winter it saved him so
much coal that his motive power cost him almost nothing. By
thus uniting the production of power and heat he showed, as few
men have shown, how a great waste may be exchanged for a large
profit. In the Northern States and in Canada the main use for
fuel is for heating not only dwellings, but the furnaces that pour
out iron and steel, the ovens that bake pottery, tiles, and so on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
When but moderate temperatures are desired, as in warming a
house, exhaust steam serves admirably, and so might the exhausts
from gas engines. Indeed we here strike the key-note of modern
fuel economy which is that wherever possible fuel should first
deliver all the motive power that can be squeezed out of it, when
and only when the remainder of its heat, much the larger part of
the whole, should be used for warming.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a
href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> This plan, already
adopted in a good many cases, can be vastly extended with profit.
In blast furnaces the first task of the fuel is performed at an extreme
temperature; that work completed the gases of combustion
may be purified and sent into gas engines to produce motive power
at little cost.</p>

the best methods of heating with exhaust steam.</p></div>

<h3>Heating and Ventilating by Fans.</h3>

<p>A word was said on <a href="#Page_380">page 380</a> regarding the method now growing
in favor for heating machine-shops by sending warmed air
where it is needed, and not allowing it to go
where it would proceed of itself and be wasted.
Two illustrations show a Sturtevant <a href="#Fig282">ventilating
fan-wheel</a>, without its casing, and a <a href="#Fig283">Monogram
exhauster</a> and solid base heater, as used in many modern installations.
The net gain in sending
warmed air just where it
does most good is comparable
with the profit in mechanical
draft for a furnace as compared
with natural draft.
Either live or exhaust steam
may be used in the heating
coils through which the air is
forced by the fan. See also

<p>Steam plants which furnish
both heat and electricity
are being rapidly multiplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
throughout America. In many cases these plants supply a single
large hotel, or office building. The installation at the Mutual Life
Building, New York, is of 2400 horse-power, vying in dimensions
with many a central plant.
In Fostoria and Springfield,
Ohio, in Milwaukee, Atlanta
and other large cities, a central
station provides heat and
light and motive power to a
considerable district.</p>

<h3>District Steam Heating.</h3>

<p>At Lockport, New York, a
city of about 20,000 population,
more than 350 dwellings
and business premises are
heated by the American District
Steam Company, a concern
which has installed more
than 250 similar plants
throughout the Union. The
advantages of this system
are plain<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>cleanliness is promoted;
customers handle no
coal or ashes, tend no fires or boilers; the heat is more steadily
and equably supplied than if it came from individual boilers; heat
is ready day or night during the heating
season; the hazard from fire is lowered and
the risk of boiler explosion is abolished;
water may be heated for laundries, bath-rooms
and kitchens. Cheap fuel may be used, and stoked by machinery.
An individual boiler in a building has to be large enough
for its heaviest duty; in many cases it is called upon for but one
tenth to one fifth of its full power, with much incidental waste.
At a central station only as many boilers of a group are employed
at a time as may be worked to their full capacity, responding to
the demands of the weather.</p>

<p>At Lockport the steam-pipes are of wrought iron covered with
sheet asbestos and enclosed in a round tin-lined wood casing, having
a shell 4 inches thick, with a dead air space of about one inch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
between the tin and the asbestos. In its largest size this pipe has
shown a total loss by radiation and conduction of but one part in
four hundred in one mile; for the same distance the smallest pipe
has suffered a loss of six per cent. Live steam is used at Lockport,
but as a rule heating plants are supplied with exhaust steam.
When intensely cold weather prevails this may be supplemented
by boilers in reserve which supply live steam.</p>

<p>It is worth while to remark the tendency to unify, on lines of
the best economy, a service of both heat and electricity. In Atlanta
there were recently in operation twenty-two isolated electric
plants. The central station installed a steam heating system, and
as a result in less than a year all but two of the isolated plants
went out of business.</p>

<h3>Isolated Plants.</h3>

<p>The success of the central station at Atlanta is due to the moderate
scale of its charges. In the past there has been some complaint
of the rates levied by central stations.
In the future this complaint is likely to diminish,
because an isolated plant for the production
of heat and electricity was never before so low in cost, so
efficient in working, as to-day. Well managed central stations
broaden their market by putting a premium upon the utmost possible
use of electricity. In Brooklyn, for example, the Edison
Electric Company charges 10 cents per horse-power hour to customers
using 100 to 250 horse-power hours per month; as consumption
increases so do discounts until the customer who buys
5,000 horse-power hours pays 4 cents. The demand for current in
all its diverse applications is stimulated with energy and address.
A house or apartment of seven rooms is wired for twelve lights,
with all fixtures complete, for $95. Signs for advertising purposes
are provided <i>gratis</i>, on condition that they be lighted by the
Company. The economy of a small ice machine or a refrigerator
is pointed out all summer long, while in winter the comfort and
convenience of electric heat is as plainly kept before the public.
Such a policy as this takes account of the irrepressible facts of
present day competition. When gas was the sole illuminant, producible
only on a vast scale, served by an elaborate scheme of
piping that from the nature of the case fell into a single hand,
there was a liability to extortion. To-day in towns and cities electricity,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
the chief source of light, can be ground out anywhere
simply, cheaply and without offence, incidentally affording when
desired almost as much heat as if the fuel had been burnt to produce
nothing else. Among the gifts bestowed by the electrician
not the least is this conferring at the lowest price two prime necessities
of life. But however liberal the management of a central
station, many a fat plum will remain outside its pudding. A huge
hotel, an office-building, factory, or department store, is best
served by a plant of its own designed to furnish both heat and
electricity, in which case the electric current will cost much less
than if bought from a central station.</p>

<p>On occasion an isolated plant supplies a neighborhood, and at
prices lower than those of a large central station which may be at
a considerable distance. At Newark in the New Jersey Freie
Zeitung building a 400 kilowatt plant is installed which supplies
the neighbors in two blocks with electricity at 6 to 8 cents per
kilowatt hour, according to the extent of their consumption. A
necessary conduit crosses Campbell Street in this service. It
seems likely that small power-centres of this kind, requiring no
franchise, may be common in the near future, especially if united
with heating systems. An inviting field for such installations is
in the new residential quarters of our cities and towns, where in
many cases a whole block might be cheaply and effectively served
from a single plant.</p>

<h3>Gas for Heat, Light and Power.</h3>

<p>Heat, light and motive power may be provided either by steam
or by gas. Modern industry does not tie itself to any particular
servant, but chooses in turn whichever, under
the circumstances of a case, will serve it well at
least cost. Where natural gas is to be had at a
low price it holds the field. But the area thus
favored is small, so that producer gas is employed on a much
larger scale. We have already seen (<a href="#Page_461">page 461</a>) how coal may be
gasified, valuable by-products seized, and a cheap gas be piped for
miles with no liability to the condensation which befalls steam,
while available for heating and for motive power. When this gas
burns at a fairly high temperature, as does Dowson gas, it gives
with thorium mantles a good light, so as to be an all round rival
of electricity. Producer gas is preferable to solid coal because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
perfectly clean; it banishes the smoke nuisance, and is regulated
by a touch. Mr. F. W. Harbord in his work on Steel (see <a href="#Page_177">page
177</a>), says<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The ease with which perfect combustion of a gas can be obtained
by regulating the supply of gas and air, the readiness with
which it can be conducted to any required point, superheated or
burned under pressure, made to give an oxidizing or a reducing
flame at pleasure, and the general control that can be exercised
over the size and temperature of the flame, in most cases more
than compensate for the reduction in heat units due to gasification. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The necessity for superheating the fuel, and for
keeping solid fuel out of contact with the bath of metal, make
gaseous fuel indispensable in the open hearth furnace, and until
Siemens solved the problem of cheap gasification of coal, this process
of steel-making was impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaseous fuels are employed not only in steel making but in the
manufacture of glass, pottery, chemicals, and much else.</p>

<p>When gas is used in gas engines to produce motive power, the
exhausts having high temperatures may be profitably applied to
heating water, or raising steam, for warming purposes.</p>

<p>Whether central stations employ steam or gas, or unite both, it
is certain that a unification of the service of heat, light, and
motive power including that required for traction, would in all
our towns and cities be attended by great economy, by the abolition
of much discomfort and unnecessary drudgery. A large city,
such as New York or Chicago, could be supplied with these three
cardinal necessities from comparatively few centres.</p>

</div>

<h3>Electric Traction.</h3>

<p>Such centres may, before many years elapse, be found stretching
out into the distant suburbs of cities, and linking town to town.
This chiefly because electricity has become a
formidable rival to steam in interurban locomotion.
By the time this page is printed, the
New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad will have begun
operating its suburban trains from New York by electricity. For
this service locomotives built by the General Electric Company,
Schenectady, New York, will be in commission. Each will develop
2,200 to 3,000 horse-power. In careful tests a locomotive
of this kind reached a speed of fifty miles an hour in 127 seconds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
whereas a &#8220;Pacific&#8221; steam locomotive required 203 seconds; an
important difference, especially where stops are frequent. Each
locomotive, with its train of cars, weighed 513 tons. The steam
locomotive with its tender weighed 171 tons; its electric rival
weighed but 100 tons. So much for the gain in leaving both
furnace and boiler at home, while their power is received through
a special rail at rest.</p>

<h3>The Drift to Cities.</h3>

<p class="chapstart">In the closing chapter of this book it may be permissible to
glance for a moment at a few of the social and national consequences
of invention. While, as we have seen in earlier chapters,
the economic gains of ingenuity surpass computation, the
work of the inventor has brought in its train
evil as well as good, and this evil, with the
further march of invention, is being plainly
lessened year by year. A century ago about
one tenth of the people in North America lived in cities and
towns; to-day these centers of population hold nearly one half
the families of the continent. Many observers regard this drift
from country to city and town with dislike and alarm, without
recognizing it to be inevitable. They paint pictures of country
folk attracted by the superficial allurements of the city, a poor
exchange for the wholesomeness and freedom of life in the country.
They argue that with wise education the boys and girls
reared on the farm will remain there, greatly to the gain of themselves
and the nation. These critics leave out of view the feats
of the inventor. Between 1870 and 1880 the self-binding
harvester was perfected and introduced. Before its advent six
or seven men followed every harvester to tie its shocks of grain.
After the self-binder came into vogue, five of these men were no
longer needed. Other inventions, planters, corn-shellers, and the
like, as economical of labor, have been placed in the farme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>r&#8217;s
hands within the past thirty years. The result being that to raise
on farms the food for a million men, women and children, a
greatly reduced staff in the field suffices to-day in comparison
with the number required thirty or forty years ago. And what
has become of the country population thus thrown out of work
by thews of steel and brass? It has quietly betaken itself to
towns and cities where, for the most part, it is manufacturing
new comforts and luxuries for all the people, whether in town or
country. In 1870 out of 100 wage-earners in the United States,
29 were engaged in manufactures, trade and transportation; in
1900 the corresponding figure had risen to 40. Enter this morning
the house of a thrifty farmer or mechanic: you tread on a
neat carpet, you see good furniture, a piano in the parlor, a bicycle
in the barn. On the walls are attractive pictures, flanked by
shelves of books and magazines. In not a few such houses one
may find a telephone and electric lamps. As recently as 1870
some of these things did not exist at all, even for the rich. To-day
they are enjoyed by millions. So with clothing: it is to-day
better and cheaper than ever before. Food, too, is more varied
and more wholesome than of yore, thanks to the express train,
the quick steamer, the cold storage warehouse. All these agencies
of betterment, and many more, are conducted in cities as the
centers of capital, industry and population. While invention has,
in the main, tended to make cities bigger than ever, it is now
modifying that tendency by its rapid trolley lines to suburbs, its
steamboat and railroad services constantly quickened in pace and
lowered in fares. On the outskirts of Greater New York it is
still possible for a wage-earner to buy land for a house and small
garden, the burden of rent, liable to yearly increase, being escaped
for good and all.</p>

<h3>The Factory System and Checks Thereto.</h3>

<p>It was in England toward the end of the eighteenth century that
inventors first lifted the latch for an industrial revolution. When
James Watt devised his steam engine, and its
power was applied to spinning and weaving,
these tasks were driven from the home to the
factory, there to be more economically performed.
Other industries followed, all the way from paint grinding
to nail making, so that in a few years a profound change came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
over the field of labor. Under a scheme of subdivided toil the factory
hand succeeded to the journeyman who, with a few mates, had
split nails or drawn wire in a shop no bigger than some day he
might own for himself. With the need to occupy large premises,
to install engines and elaborate machinery, the capital of an employer
has to be vastly more than of old, creating a new dependence
on the part of the workman, and rendering it all but impossible
that he should ever have a factory of his own. While
the factory system of production is general in America, it is far
from universal. Many leading manufactures, those of textiles,
of boots and shoes, and so on, are usually conducted in factories,
while some important industries, that of clothing, for example,
are for the most part carried on at the homes of work people, or
in small shops. Massachusetts in 1900, according to the U. S.
census of that year, had 200,508 hands in 1078 textile mills and
boot and shoe factories. Apart from these industries were 28,102
factories and shops, employing 291,418 hands, an average of but
10.57 each.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44"
class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Taking the United States as a whole, the census for
1900 reports that the hand trades in small shops representing a
product of $500 or less each, numbered 127,419. Presumably in
all these cases the worker toiled by himself, usually as a repairer
or a jobber rather than as a maker of new wares. All the other
manufacturing concerns, 512,675 in number, employed on an
average only 10.36 persons each. It is clear that the American
factory is not as engulfing as many critics believe it to be. In
larger measure than is commonly supposed workmen are to-day
their own masters, or are busy in shops small enough to give
scope to individual ingenuity and skill.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_44" id="Footnote_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44"><span
class="label">[44]</span></a> Quoted by Edward Atkinson in a paper on the tendencies of manufacturing.
American Social Science Association, 1904.</p></div>

<p>Let us grant that a shoemaker, say in St. Louis, at work in a
stall of his own is a better and happier man than if in a nearby
factory he fastened eyelets, or burnished heels, day in and day out
for years together. While the harm to the toiler wrought by
extreme subdivision of labor is plain, its evils are being abated
in more ways than one. First of all the productiveness of the
modern factory has so augmented the joint dividend of capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
and labor that while the working day grows shorter, wages are
increased, every earned dollar buying more manufactured wares
than ever before. Secondly, in some large railroad and other
shops the workmen are given a variety of tasks in succession, so
as to be more versatile, more useful in emergencies, than if ever
punching steel, or threading bolts. Even if the result of such a
plan is to diminish the total output in the course of a year, it is
worth while to lose some money that human nature may be redeemed
from stupefying monotony of toil. High wages and
large dividends cost too much when bought at the expense of hurt
to muscle, nerve and brain.</p>

<h3>Handicrafts Revived.</h3>

<p>And a notable group of artisans, few in number but steadily
increasing, with electric motors at their elbows, to-day enjoy complete
emancipation from the factory bell. A
woodcarver, bookbinder, leather stamper,
forger of ornamental iron, rug weaver, potter,
lens grinder, or printer, can have to-day a shop of his own and
take pleasure in the chosen and constantly varied toil that gives
him bread. In their simpler forms the modern lathe, loom, printing
press, are cheap enough to be within the means of poor men,
while their product when it displays taste and originality is sure
of a market. In times past Palissy, Hargreaves, and many another
master of a handicraft, has perfected a remarkable invention
in a small shop. We may expect the arts to receive golden
gifts in the future from the successors of these men, feeling as
they do the stimulus of a broadening demand for work executed
on new lines of excellence.</p>

<h3>Tendencies Against Centralization.</h3>

<p>Until within a few years past economic forces in America
threatened soon to place its chief industries in the hands of a few
men, so strong and unscrupulous as to be able
to extort weighty and increasing tribute. For
this danger remedies legislative and judicial
are being sought, with the prospect of eventual
success. In this place it may be allowable to remark how the
progress of invention is working hand in hand with the aims of
social justice. In the pages immediately preceding this chapter
we have seen how cities and towns are working themselves loose
from monopoly. A gas supply, on the old basis of manufacture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
at least, must be a unit, with a strong temptation to overcharge
its customers. To-day the lighting field is shared with electricity,
showing many isolated plants; when these purvey heat as well as
light their rivalry with central stations may become formidable.
In American villages and small towns the principal source of light
is petroleum, largely controlled by the Standard Oil Company.
From its exactions there opens escape as the farmer finds a source
of cheap alcohol in his corn, potatoes and beets, even in his unmarketable
fruit or damaged grain, ready to give him more light
than petroleum ever did, and besides propel his machinery, or
carry his crops to the nearest market town. The betterment of
common roads throughout the Union proceeds in earnest. As
that reform goes forward we may see motor-driven cars and
wagons exerting a restraining influence on local railroad rates.
Already the steam railroads are facing keen competition from interurban
electric lines. Wherever these lines resist absorption,
or control, by the steam carriers they serve the farmer so well
and cheaply as to be one of the chief boons he has received at the
inventor&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>Take one instance chosen from many as striking. Dayton,
Ohio, is a center of interurban lines which enfold in their sweep
Urbana, Columbus, Hamilton and Cincinnati. Upon 220 miles
of these lines the Southern Ohio Express Company picks up cans
of milk, cases of eggs, crates of berries, packages of tobacco,
from a thousand farmsteads. In the larger business of carrying
grain and live stock the expansion is constant, so that the day
seems near at hand when the company will find profit in placing
a switch at every farm along its lines, sending cars there for
everything the farmer has to sell. And the countryman finds
Dayton as good a place to buy in as to sell in; its merchants offer
better and cheaper wares than are to be had in the home village
or the neighboring small town. To-day a farmer or market-gardener,
a dairyman or stockbreeder, does not find the smallness
of his capital the drawback it would have been ten years ago.
With an interurban line passing near his home, or in front of his
door, with a cheap telephone at hand, and enjoying a free rural
mail delivery, he can sell his produce when he pleases and at the
best market prices, paying but a light tax to the middleman, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
completing a transaction with a directness that leaves the middleman
out altogether.</p>

<p>Steam railroads seek large trainloads to be moved long distances;
an electric freight and express service coins dimes into
dollars by picking up market baskets, bundles for the seamstress
and the laundress, a bunch or two of saplings for the orchard.
The trunk lines of America, with their wide-spreading branches,
enable merchants in the cities and the larger towns to replenish
their counters and shelves every day. Stocks, therefore, need not
be so large as of old, when, let us say, a whole winter&#8217;s goods
were laid in by October. The change reduces the amount of capital
required, the outlays for rent and insurance, the liability to shrinkage
and deterioration of values. The interurban roads are extending
these advantages to the village storekeeper who, in the morning
telephones his wants to Toledo, Cleveland, or Detroit; and in
the afternoon disposes the ordered wares on his shelves.<a

<h3>New Domestic Architecture.</h3>

<p>American dwelling houses, whether in city or country, have
within forty years been much improved in plan and equipment.
To speak only of dwellings in cities, we may
note how designers and inventors have promoted
comfort and convenience, healthfulness
and cheer. At the close of the Civil War an
ordinary house in Philadelphia, or Chicago, as it left the builder&#8217;s
hands was little else than a bare box. Stoves for warming and
cooking had to be brought into it, wardrobes heavy and clumsy
were placed beside its walls, cupboards meant to be moved and
not moved easily held the raiment and table linen. In rented
houses the gas fixtures might belong to the tenant; when he took
them away ugly breaks appeared in walls and ceilings. To-day
all this is of the past: in important details the design of the
mansion is embodied in dwellings comparatively small. Furnaces
for heating, ranges for cooking, form part and parcel of the
building; fixtures for gas and electricity, yielding both light and
heat, are provided just as water faucets are; every bedroom has
its clothes closet instead of the lumbering wardrobe. In the
kitchen we find dressers and china closets built into the walls;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
the laundry has stationary washtubs and, in some cases, a drying
room as well, so that the laundress does not care should it rain on
washing day. The aim throughout is that the house and its
equipment shall as far as possible make up a unit, that the labor
of housekeeping be minimized to the utmost by a judicious outlay
of capital when the house is built.</p>

<h3>Electricity at Home.</h3>

<p>Since 1900 the American householder, as well as the American
business man, has fairly awakened to what the telephone can do
for him. It is estimated that in 1905 the telephone
in the United States earned four times
as much as the telegraph. The day is at hand
when every household but the poorest will enjoy the wonderful
gift of Professor Bell. In somewhat the same fashion it is dawning
upon the public that electricity stands ready to perform other
services, each minor, but all, in the aggregate, going far to promote
health and comfort at home.</p>

<p>At Schenectady, New York, Mr. H. W. Hillman, apart from
heating in winter, has adopted electricity for many household
tasks, with results described and illustrated in the Technical
World, Chicago, July, 1906. His kitchen outfit for a family of
five persons comprises an electric table, oven, griddle-cake cooker,
meat broiler, cereal cooker, water heater, egg boiler, potato
steamer, frying pan, coffee percolator, and a stove for ordinary
cooking utensils. A three pound nickel plated electric iron is provided
for the laundry. In the dining-room is an electric chafing
dish and a percolator. On the verandah and in the den are
electric cigar lighters. In the sewing-room the machine is driven
by an electric motor. The bathroom has an electric mug which
heats water for shaving in less than a minute; in chilly weather
the luminous radiator yields just the slight heat which ensures
comfort instead of discomfort. Of course, throughout the house
electric lamps furnish light with the maximum of convenience
and wholesomeness, the minimum of risk.</p>

<p>How does this service compare in cost with the employment of
coal and gas? With coal at $6.50 a ton, and gas at $1.30 per
thousand cubic feet, the average monthly expense was formerly
$6.00; with electricity the bills are but 69 cents more per month, a
mere trifle in comparison with the gain in comfort, the saving of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
drudgery, the promotion of cleanliness. The rate for electricity
used for lighting is 10 cents per kilowatt hour, for heating only
half that rate.</p>

<p>Mr. Hillman does not use electric heat for ordinary warming:
it would cost him too much. A good many people are puzzled by
the fact that an electric current, which yields a perfect light at a
reasonable price, should in the sister task of heating fail in rivalry
with a common stove or furnace. To solve this puzzle let us
place our hands above a cluster of 15 Edison incandescent lamps,
each of 16 candle power, representing one horse power, yet emitting
no more heat than if three ounces of coal were slowly burning
away in the course of an hour. This electricity may cost us
ten cents an hour, the coal costs but the fifteenth part of one cent.
In producing mechanical motion at a power-house, the engines
waste at least ninety per cent. of the applied heat. To this heavy
tax must be added the expenses of distribution, administration
and maintenance. Until, therefore, the electrician reaches a mode
of creating his current from heat without the enormous losses of
present practice, we cannot look to him for a system of general
heating. A word has already been said in this book about methods
of district heating by steam. Another plan is worthy of mention.
In Brooklyn the Morris Building Company supplies from a central
plant fifty-two dwellings with hot water which serves not
only for heating, but for cooking and washing also. The water
is heated in part by live steam, in part by exhausts from steam
engines.</p>

<h3>Suggested Exhibits.</h3>

<p>Such an experiment as this, the appliances at work for Mr.
Hillman, suggest exhibits which might form part of the premises
of agricultural colleges and technical schools.
These establishments usually require for their
officers such dwellings as are not too large and
costly for ordinary householders. These dwellings, carefully designed
and equipped, might serve as examples of the best practice
in building, planning and appointment; in sound methods of heating
from a central plant. At suitable times they might be open to
public inspection. They might range in cost from $1,000 to
$5,000, the cheapest to be built of wood, others to be built in
brick, stone, or concrete. All the furniture and fittings to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
chosen with an eye to wholesomeness, durability, and maintenance
with the least labor possible. Each house should contain in its
main room a card telling the cost of the building, with estimates
of cost if executed in other materials. On occasion this plan
might be extended to the contents of houses, each item on show
days to be duly labeled. A series of such houses would tend to
bring ordinary house-planning and housekeeping to the level of
the best. Many books and journals offer architectural diagrams
which few can understand, but everybody can see how attractive
a good plan is when realized in a house to which he pays a
leisurely visit. At Expositions, such as those of Chicago and St.
Louis, the appeal of the architect and the exhibitor is rather to
wonder than to utility. He shows us schlosses from Germany,
palaces from Italy, ch&acirc;teaux from France, all appointed with
costly magnificence. But while the average American wage is
eleven dollars a week these displays can do little good as models
for imitation.</p>

<h3 class="centred">NOTE ON THE LITERATURE OF INVENTION AND
DISCOVERY</h3>

<div class="fsize90">

<p>Books on invention and discovery are mentioned here and there throughout
this volume. The reader may wish further references, in which case
he may find them at the public library nearest home. Within the past
few years the public libraries of America have been laying stress on their
educational departments, are becoming more and more a worthy complement
to the public schools.</p>

<p>At the Carnegie Library, Pittsburg, the department of technology is directed
by Mr. Harrison W. Craver, a graduate of a polytechnical institute,
who has had experience as a practicing chemist. The collection keeps
mainly to lines of local interest, and includes an ample array of trade
journals. Indexes to articles in technical journals are maintained. On
the shelves are files of patents of the leading nations of the world. Short
lists of books on subjects of current interest are from time to time compiled
and issued. Workers receive advice and personal assistance from
scientifically trained men. Questions are answered by mail and telephone.
Notes on books are appended to their titles on the catalogue cards, and in
the monthly bulletin.</p>

<p>Mr. Craver&#8217;s aid extends to other public libraries, among them to
that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
at Providence. Here the industrial department contains about 7600 volumes,
chiefly devoted to the principal industries of the city,&mdash;textiles, electrical
arts, machinery, and the arts of design, especially in jewelry. A
room is at the service of draughtsmen: a dark closet is available for copyists
who bring cameras. When a new book comes in the reader or the
artist likely to want it is notified.</p>

<p>The Pratt Institute Free Library, Brooklyn, has an applied science reference
room which receives 115 scientific, technical and trade journals. It
has brought together a large collection of trade catalogues, duly classified,
and a collection of cuts of machines and mechanical devices. The custodian
makes it his business to visit the neighboring factories and workshops, so
as to provide every publication likely to be of help. The use of this department
increases steadily, with a marked effect on the proportion of
scientific books taken from the general library for home reading.</p>

<p>Newark, a city of many and diverse manufactures, has a public library
also of the first rank. Scientific books, as received, are brought to public
attention through the press, and by means of the monthly bulletin mailed
to any one on request. Short lists of selected works on particular branches
of applied science are prepared for gratuitous distribution: in each book of
a series the full list is pasted as a guide to extended reading. Readers are
invited to ask for any book not in the library which they believe would be
of service to them.</p>

<p>These are but a few examples of the work the public libraries are doing
throughout the Union. At the headquarters of the American Library Association
are issued manifold aids for readers and students: a list of them is
given on a page following the index to this book. Let us hope that one of
these days the Association may establish a bureau through which the
literature of applied science, and all other worthy literature, may be passed
upon by a staff of the best critics, for the behoof of all the people. Such
a service would inure not only to the good of those who borrow books from
public libraries, but would afford help to the men and women who buy
books for libraries of their own.</p>

THE CAMERA</b></p>

<p class="center fsize125 blankabove blankbelow"><span class="smcap">By</span> GEORGE ILES</p>


<p>A concise and brilliant recital of the chief uses of fire, electricity
and photography. The steam turbine, the production of
utmost cold, the R&ouml;ntgen ray apparatus, the revelations of the
sensitive plate directed to the sky, color photography, the wireless
telegraph, are among the inventions depicted and explained.</p>

<p>The original points in the book are:</p>

<p>Proof that <span class="smcap">Electricity</span> can do all that <span class="smcap">Fire</span> does, do it better,
and then accomplish uncounted tasks impossible to flame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Photography</span> is shown to be the one radical advance in depiction
since art began. In days of old an object had to be seen
before it could be pictured; to-day new heavens and a new earth
impress their images first in the camera, to declare themselves
only afterward to the eye.</p>

<p>Heretofore <span class="smcap">Evolution</span> has been explained by mere excellence
in swiftness, strength, vision. This book points out how the ability
to change the forms of things flowered into the capacity to
change their properties as well. When an arrowmaker in striking
flint against flint kindled flame, and repeated the feat at will,
he opened at once a new world for humankind, incomparably
higher and broader than if he had simply acquired a nicer touch,
a steadier aim, a quicker ear for the rustle of leaf or wing. It
is the like maturing of old resources into new, of infinitely greater
scope, that has brought man to the supremacy of Nature, while
his next of kin remain beasts of the glade.</p>
